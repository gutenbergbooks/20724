<h3>WHEREIN THEY KILL THE FATTED CALF TO CELEBRATE THE RETURN OF A
FRUGAL SON.</h3>


<p>On the 18th of May, 1859, M. Renault, formerly professor of physics
and chemistry, now a landed proprietor at Fontainebleau, and member of
the Municipal Council of that charming little city, himself carried to
the post-office the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"<i>To Monsieur Leon Renault, Civil Engineer, Berlin,
Prussia.</i><br> <br> (To be kept at the Post-Office till called
for.)<br> <br> "<span class="smcap">My dear child:</span><br>
</p>

<blockquote><p>"The good news you sent us from St. Petersburg caused
us the greatest joy. Your poor mother had been ailing since winter,
but I had not spoken to you about it from fear of making you uneasy
while so far from home. As for myself, I had not been very well; and
there was yet a third person (guess the name if you can!) who was
languishing from not seeing you. But content yourself, my dear Leon:
we have been recuperating more and more since the time of your return
is almost fixed. We begin to believe that
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg
2]</a></span> mines of the Ural will not swallow up that which is
dearer to us than all the world. Thank God! that fortune which you
have so honorably and so quickly made will not have cost your life,
nor even your health, since you tell us you have been growing fat off
there in the desert. If you have not finished up all your business out
there, so much the worse for you: there are three of us who have sworn
that you shall never go back again. You will not find it hard to
accede, for you will be happy among us. Such, at least, is the opinion
of Clementine.... I forget that I was pledged not to name her. Master
Bonnivet, our excellent neighbor, has not rested content with
investing your funds in a good mortgage, but has also drawn up, in his
leisure moments, a most edifying little indenture, which now lacks
nothing but your signature. Our worthy mayor has ordered, on your
account, a new official scarf, which is on the way from Paris. You
will have the first benefit of it. Your apartment (which will soon
belong to a plural 'you') is elegant, in proportion to your present
fortune. You are to occupy....; but the house has changed so in three
years, that my description would be incomprehensible to you. M.
Audret, the architect of the imperial chateau, directed the work. He
actually wanted to construct me a laboratory worthy of Th&eacute;nard
or Duprez. I earnestly protested against it, and said that I was not
yet worthy of one, as my celebrated work on the Condensation of Gases
had only reached the fourth chapter. But as your mother was in
collusion with the old scamp of a friend, it has turned out that
science has henceforth a temple in our house&mdash;a regular
sorcerer's den, according to the picturesque expression of your old
Gothon: it lacks nothing, not even a four-horse-power steam engine.
Alas! what can I do with it? I am confident, nevertheless, that the
expenditure will not be altogether lost to the world. You are not
going to sleep upon your laurels. Oh, if I had only had your fortune
when I had your youth! I would have dedicated my days to pure science,
instead of losing the best part of them among those poor young men who
got nothing from my lectures but an opportunity to read Paul de Kock.
I would have been
ambitious!&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3"
id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> would have striven to connect my name
with the discovery of some great general law, or at least with the
invention of some very useful apparatus. It is too late now; my eyes
are worn out, and the brain itself refuses to work. Take your turn, my
boy! You are not yet twenty-six, the Ural mines have given you the
wherewithal to live at ease, and, for yourself alone, you have no
further wants to satisfy; the time has come to work for humanity. That
you will do so, is the strongest wish and dearest hope of your doting
old father, who loves you and who waits for you with open arms.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">J. Renault.</span></p>

<p>"P. S. According to my calculations, this letter ought to reach
Berlin two or three days before you. You have been already informed by
the papers of the 7th inst. of the death of the illustrious Humboldt.
It is a cause of mourning to science and to humanity. I have had the
honor of writing to that great man several times in my life, and he
once deigned to reply, in a letter which I piously cherish. If you
happen to have an opportunity to buy some personal souvenir of him, a
bit of his handwriting or some fragment of his collections, you will
bring me a real pleasure." </p></blockquote>

<p>A month after the departure of this letter, the son so eagerly
looked for returned to the paternal mansion. M. and Mme. Renault, who
went to meet him at the depot, found him taller, stouter, and
better-looking in every way. In fact, he was no longer merely a
remarkable boy, but a man of good and pleasing proportions. Leon
Renault was of medium height, light hair and complexion, plump and
well made. His large blue eyes, sweet voice, and silken beard
indicated a nature sensitive rather than powerful. A very white,
round, and almost feminine neck contrasted singularly with a face
bronzed by exposure. His teeth were beautiful, very delicate,
a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
little inclined backward, and very evenly shaped. When he pulled off
his gloves, he displayed two small and rather pudgey hands, quite firm
and yet pleasantly soft, neither hot nor cold, nor dry nor damp, but
agreeable to the touch and cared-for to perfection.</p>

<p>As he was, his father and mother would not have exchanged him for
the Apollo Belvedere. They embraced him rapturously, overwhelming him
with a thousand questions, most of which he, of course, failed to
answer. Some old friends of the family, a doctor, an architect, and a
notary, had run to the depot with the good old people; each one of
them in turn gave him a hug, and asked him if he was well, and if he
had had a pleasant journey. He listened patiently and even joyfully to
this common-place music whose words did not signify much, but whose
melody went to the heart because it came from the heart.</p>

<p>They had been there a good quarter of an hour, the train had gone
puffing on its way, the omnibuses of the various hotels had started
one after another at a good trot up the street leading to the city,
and the June sun seemed to enjoy lighting up this happy group of
excellent people. But Madame Renault cried out all at once that the
poor child must be dying of hunger, and that it was barbarous to keep
him waiting for his dinner any longer. There was no use in his
protesting that he had breakfasted at Paris, and that the voice of
hunger appealed to him less strongly than that of joy. They all got
into two carriages, the son beside his mother, the
father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg
5]</a></span> opposite, as if he could not keep his eyes off his boy.
A wagon came behind with the trunks, long boxes, chests, and the rest
of the traveller's baggage. At the entrance of the town, the hackmen
cracked their whips, the baggage-men followed the example, and this
cheerful clatter drew the people to their doors and woke up for an
instant the quietude of the streets. Madame Renault threw her glances
right and left, searching out the spectators of her triumph, and
saluting with most cordial affability people she hardly knew at all.
And more than one mother saluted her, too, without knowing her; for
there is no mother indifferent to such kinds of happiness, and,
moreover, Leon's family was liked by everybody. And the neighbors,
meeting each other, said with a satisfaction free from jealousy:</p>

<p>"That is Renault's son, who has been at work three years in the
Russian mines, and now has come to share his fortune with his old
parents."</p>

<p>Leon also noticed several familiar faces, but not all that he
wished to see. For he bent over an instant to his mother's ear,
saying: "And Clementine?" This word was pronounced so low and so close
that M. Renault himself could not tell whether it was a word or a
kiss. The good lady smiled tenderly, and answered but a single word:
"Patience!" As if patience were a virtue very common among lovers!</p>

<p>The door of the house was wide open, and old Gothon was standing on
the threshold. She raised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6"
id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> her arms toward heaven and cried like a
booby, for she had known Leon since he was not much higher than her
wash-tub. There was now another formidable hugging on the upper step,
between the good old servant and her young master. After a reasonable
interval, the friends of M. Renault prepared to leave, but it was
wasted pains; for they were assured that their places at table had
already been prepared. And when all save the invisible Clementine were
reassembled in the parlor, the great round-backed chairs held out
their arms to the scion of the house of Renault; the old mirror on the
mantle delighted to reflect his image; the great chandelier chimed a
little song of welcome with its crystal pendants, and the mandarins on
the etag&eacute;re shook their heads in sign of welcome, as if they
were orthodox <i>penates</i> instead of strangers and pagans. No one
can tell why kisses and tears began to rain down again, but it
certainly did seem as if he had once more just returned.</p>

<p>"Soup!" cried Gothon.</p>

<p>Madame Renault took the arm of her son, contrary to all the laws of
etiquette, and without even apologizing to the honored guests present.
She scarcely excused herself, even, for helping the son before the
company. Leon let her have her own way, and took it all smilingly:
there was not a guest there who was not ready to upset his soup over
his waistcoat rather than taste it before Leon.</p>

<p>"Mother!" cried Leon, spoon in hand, "this
is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the first time for three years that I've tasted good soup." Madame
Renault felt herself blush with satisfaction, and Gothon was so
overcome that she dropped a plate. Both fancied that possibly he had
spoken to please their self-conceit; but nevertheless he spoke truly.
There are two things in this world which a man does not often find
away from home: the first is good soup; the second is disinterested
love.</p>

<p>If I should attempt here an accurate enumeration of all the dishes
that appeared on the table, there would not be one of my readers whose
mouth would not water. I believe, indeed, that more than one delicate
lady would be in danger of an attack of indigestion. Suppose, if you
please, that such a list would reach nearly to the end of the volume,
leaving me but a single page on which to write the marvellous history
of Fougas. Therefore I forthwith return to the parlor, where coffee is
already served.</p>

<p>Leon took scarcely half of his cup: but do not let that lead you to
infer that the coffee was too hot, or too cold, or too sweet. Nothing
in the world would have prevented his drinking it to the last drop, if
a knock at the street-door had not stopped it just opposite his
heart.</p>

<p>The minute which followed appeared to him interminable. Never in
his travels had he encountered such a long minute. But at length
Clementine appeared, preceded by the worthy Mlle. Virginie Sambucco,
her aunt; and the mandarins who smiled on the etag&eacute;re heard the
sound of three kisses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8"
id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> Wherefore three? The superficial reader,
who pretends to foresee things before they are written, has already
found a very probable explanation. "Of course," says he, "Leon was too
respectful to embrace the dignified Mlle. Sambucco more than once, but
when he came to Clementine, who was soon to become his wife, he very
properly doubled the dose." Now sir, that is what I call a premature
judgment! The first kiss fell from the mouth of Leon upon the cheek of
Mlle. Sambucco; the second was applied by the lips of Mlle. Sambucco
to the right cheek of Leon; the third was, in fact, an accident that
plunged two young hearts into profound consternation.</p>

<p>Leon, who was very much in love with his betrothed, rushed to her
blindly, uncertain whether he would kiss her right cheek or her left,
but determined not to put off too long a pleasure which he had been
promising himself ever since the spring of 1856. Clementine did not
dream of defending herself, but was fully prepared to apply her pretty
rosy lips to Leon's right cheek or his left, indifferently. The
precipitation of the two young people brought it about that neither
Clementine's cheeks nor Leon's received the offering intended for
them. And the mandarins on the etag&eacute;re, who fully expected to
hear two kisses, heard but one. And Leon was confounded, and
Clementine blushed up to her ears, and the two lovers retreated a
step, intently regarding the roses of the carpet which will remain
eternally graven upon their
memories.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg
9]</a></span></p>

<p>In the eyes of Leon Renault, Clementine was the most beautiful
creature in the world. He had loved her for little more than three
years, and it was somewhat on her account that he had taken the
journey to Russia. In 1856 she was too young to marry, and too rich
for an engineer with a salary of 2,400 francs to properly make
pretentions to her hand. Leon, who was a good mathematician, proposed
to himself the following problem: "Given&mdash;one young girl, fifteen
and a half years old, with an income of 8,000 francs, and threatened
with the inheritance from Mlle. Sambucco of, say 200,000
more:&mdash;to obtain a fortune at least equal to hers within such a
period as will give her time enough to grow up, without leaving her
time enough to become an old maid." He had found the solution in the
Ural mines.</p>

<p>During three long years, he had indirectly corresponded with the
beloved of his heart. All the letters which he wrote to his father or
mother, passed into the hands of Mlle. Sambucco, who did not keep them
from Clementine. Sometimes, indeed, they were read aloud in the
family, and M. Renault was never obliged to omit a phrase, for Leon
never wrote anything which a young girl should not hear. The aunt and
the niece had no other distractions; they lived retired in a little
house at the end of a pretty garden, and received no one but old
friends. Clementine, therefore, deserved but little credit for keeping
her heart for Leon. With the exception of a big colonel of
cuirassiers, who sometimes followed her
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg
10]</a></span> her walks, no man had ever made any demonstrations
toward her.</p>

<p>She was very pretty withal, and not so merely to the eyes of her
lover, or of the Renault family, or of the little city where she
lived. Provincial towns are apt to be easily satisfied. They give the
reputation of being a pretty woman or a great man, cheaply; especially
when they are not rich enough in such commodities to show themselves
over particular. In capitals, however, people claim to admire nothing
but absolute merit. I have heard the mayor of a village say, with a
certain pride: "Admit now, that my servant Catherine is right pretty,
for a village of six hundred people!" Clementine was pretty enough to
be admired in a city of eight hundred thousand. Fancy to yourself a
little blonde creole, with black eyes, creamy complexion and dazzling
teeth. Her figure was round and supple as a twig, and was finished off
with dainty hands and pretty Andalusian feet, arched and beautifully
rounded. All her glances were smiles, and all her movements caresses.
Add to this, that she was neither a fool nor a prude, nor even an
ignoramus like girls brought up in convents. Her education, which was
begun by her mother, had been completed by two or three respectable
old professors selected by M. Renault, who was her guardian. She had a
sound heart, and a quick mind. But I may reasonably ask myself why I
have so much to say about her, for she is still living; and, thank
God! not one of her perfections has
departed</p>

<h3>UNPACKING BY CANDLE-LIGHT.</h3>


<p>About ten o'clock in the evening, Mlle. Virginie Sambucco said it
was time to think of going home: the ladies lived with monastic
regularity. Leon protested; but Clementine obeyed, though not without
pouting a little. Already the parlor door was open, and the old lady
had taken her hood in the hall, when the engineer, suddenly struck
with an idea, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You surely won't go without helping me to open my trunks! I demand
it of you as a favor, my good Mademoiselle Sambucco!"</p>

<p>The respectable lady paused: custom urged her to go; kindness
inclined her to stay; an atom of curiosity swayed the balance.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad!" cried Clementine, replacing her aunt's hood on the
rack.</p>

<p>Mme. Renault did not yet know where they had put Leon's baggage.
Gothon came to say that everything had been thrown pell-mell into the
sorcerer's den, to remain there until Monsieur
should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg
12]</a></span> point out what he wanted taken to his own room. The
whole company, armed with lamps and candles, betook themselves to a
vast room on the ground floor, where furnaces, retorts, philosophical
instruments, boxes, trunks, clothes bags, hat boxes and the famous
steam-engine, formed a confused and entertaining spectacle. The light
played about this interior, as it appears to in certain pictures of
the Dutch school. It glanced upon the great yellow cylinders of the
electric machine, struck upon the long glass bottles, rebounded from
two silver reflectors, and rested, in passing, upon a magnificent
Fortin barometer. The Renaults and their friends, grouped in the midst
of the boxes&mdash;some sitting, some standing, one holding a lamp,
another a candle&mdash;detracted nothing from the picturesqueness of
the scene.</p>

<p>Leon, with a bunch of little keys, opened the boxes one after
another. Clementine was seated opposite him on a great oblong box, and
watched him with all her eyes, more from affection than curiosity.
They began by setting to one side two enormous square boxes which
contained nothing but mineralogical specimens. After this they passed
in review the riches of all kinds which the engineer had crowded among
his linen and clothing.</p>

<p>A pleasant odor of Russia leather, tea from the caravans, Levant
tobacco, and attar of roses soon permeated the laboratory. Leon
brought forth a little at a time, as is the custom of
all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg
13]</a></span> rich travellers who, on leaving home, left a family and
good stock of friends behind. He exhibited, in turn, fabrics of the
Asiatic looms, narghiles of embossed silver from Persia, boxes of tea,
sherbets flavored with rose, precious extracts, golden webs from
Tarjok, antique armor, a service of frosted silver of Toula make,
jewelry mounted in the Russian style, Caucasian bracelets, necklaces
of milky amber, and a leather sack full of turquoises such as they
sell at the fair of Nijni Novgorod. Each object passed from hand to
hand amid questions, explanations, and interjections of all kinds. All
the friends present received the gifts intended for them. There was a
concert of polite refusals, friendly urgings, and 'thank-yous' in all
sorts of voices. It is unnecessary to say that much the greater share
fell to the lot of Clementine; but she did not wait to be urged to
accept them, for, in the existing state of affairs, all these pretty
things would be but as a part of the wedding gifts&mdash;not going out
of the family.</p>

<p>Leon had brought his father an exceedingly handsome dressing gown
of a cloth embroidered with gold, some antiquarian books found in
Moscow, a pretty picture by Greuze, which had been stuck out of the
way, by the luckiest of accidents, in a mean shop at Gastinitvor; two
magnificent specimens of rock-crystal, and a cane that had belonged to
Humboldt. "You see," said he to M. Renault, on handing him this
historic staff, "that the postscript of your last letter did not fall
overboard."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg
14]</a></span> The old professor received the present with visible
emotion.</p>

<p>"I will never use it," said he to his son. "The Napoleon of science
has held it in his hand: what would one think if an old sergeant like
me should permit himself to carry it in his walks in the woods? And
the collections? Were you not able to buy anything from them? Did they
sell very high?"</p>

<p>"They were not sold," answered Leon. "All were placed in the
National Museum at Berlin. But in my eagerness to satisfy you, I made
a thief of myself in a strange way. The very day of my arrival, I told
your wish to a guide who was showing me the place. He told me that a
friend of his, a little Jew broker by the name of Ritter, wanted to
sell a very fine anatomical specimen that had belonged to the estate.
I ran to the Jew's, examined the mummy, for such it was, and, without
any haggling, paid the price he asked. But the next day, a friend of
Humboldt, Professor Hirtz, told me the history of this shred of a man,
which had been lying around the shop for more than ten years, and
never belonged to Humboldt at all. Where the deuce has Gothon stowed
it? Ah! Mlle. Clementine is sitting on it."</p>

<p>Clementine attempted to rise, but Leon made her keep seated.</p>

<p>"We have plenty of time," said he, "to take a look at the old
baggage; meanwhile you can well imagine that it is not a very cheerful
sight. This is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg
15]</a></span> the history that good old Hirtz told me; he promised to
send me, in addition, a copy of a very curious memoir on the same
subject. Don't go yet, my dear Mademoiselle Sambucco; I have a little
military and scientific romance for you. We will look at the mummy as
soon as I have acquainted you with his misfortunes."</p>

<p>"Aha!" cried M. Audret, the architect of the chateau, "it's the
romance of the mummy, is it, that you're going to tell us? Too late my
poor Leon! Theophile Gautier has gotten ahead of you, in the
supplement to the <i>Moniteur</i>, and all the world knows your
Egyptian history."</p>

<p>"My history," said Leon, "is no more Egyptian than Manon Lescault.
Our excellent doctor Martout, here, ought to know the name of
professor John Meiser, of Dantzic; he lived at the beginning of this
century, and I think that his last work appeared in 1824 or 1825."</p>

<p>"In 1823," replied M. Martout. "Meiser is one of the scientific men
who have done Germany most honor. In the midst of terrible wars which
drenched his country in blood, he followed up the researches of
Leeuwenkoeck, Baker, Needham, Fontana, and Spallanzani, on the
revivification of animals. Our profession honors in him, one of the
fathers of modern biology."</p>

<p>"Heavens! What ugly big words!" cried Mlle. Sambucco. "Is it decent
to keep people till this time of night, to make them listen to
Dutch."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg

<p>"Don't listen to the big words, dear little auntey. Save yourself
for the romance, since there is one."</p>

<p>"A terrible one!" said Leon. "Mlle. Clementine is seated over a
human victim, sacrificed to science by professor Meiser."</p>

<p>Clementine instantly got up. Her fianc&eacute; handed her a chair,
and seated himself in the place she had just left. The listeners,
fearing that Leon's romance might be in several volumes, took their
places around him, some on boxes, some on
chairs.</p>

<h3>THE CRIME OF THE LEARNED PROFESSOR MEISER.</h3>


<p>"Ladies," said Leon, "Professor Meiser was no vulgar malefactor,
but a man devoted to science and humanity. If he killed the French
colonel who at this moment reposes beneath my coat tails, it was for
the sake of saving his life, as well as of throwing light on a
question of the deepest interest, even to each one of you.</p>

<p>"The duration of our existence is very much too brief. That is a
fact which no man can contradict. We know that in a hundred years, not
one of the nine or ten persons assembled in this house will be living
on the face of the earth. Is not this a deplorable fact?"</p>

<p>Mlle. Sambucco heaved a heavy sigh, and Leon continued:</p>

<p>"Alas! Mademoiselle, like you I have sighed many a time at the
contemplation of this dire necessity. You have a niece, the most
beautiful and the most adorable of all nieces, and the sight of her
charming face gladdens your heart. But you yearn for something more;
you will not be satisfied until you have seen your little grand
nephews trotting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18"
id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> around. You will see them I earnestly
believe. But will you see their children? It is doubtful. Their
grandchildren? Impossible! In regard to the tenth, twentieth,
thirtieth generation, it is useless even to dream.</p>

<p>"One <i>will</i> dream of it, nevertheless, and perhaps there is no
man who has not said to himself at least once in his life: 'If I could
but come to life again in a couple of centuries!' One would wish to
return to earth to seek news of his family; another, of his dynasty. A
philosopher is anxious to know if the ideas that he has planted will
have borne fruit; a politician, if his party will have obtained the
upper hand; a miser, if his heirs will not have dissipated the fortune
he has made; a mere land-holder, if the trees in his garden will have
grown tall. No one is indifferent to the future destinies of this
world, which we gallop through in a few years, never to return to it
again. Who has not envied the lot of Epimenides, who went to sleep in
a cave, and, on reopening his eyes, perceived that the world had grown
old? Who has not dreamed, on his own account, of the marvellous
adventure of the sleeping Beauty in the wood?</p>

<p>"Well, ladies, Professor Meiser, one of the least visionary men of
the age, was persuaded that science could put a living being to sleep
and wake him up again at the end of an infinite number of
years&mdash;arrest all the functions of the system, suspend life
itself, protect an individual against the action
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg
19]</a></span> time for a century or two, and afterwards resuscitate
him."</p>

<p>"He was a fool then!" cried Madame Renault.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't swear it. But he had his own ideas touching the
main-spring which moves a living organism. Do you remember, good
mother mine, the impression you experienced as a little girl, when
some one first showed you the inside of a watch in motion? You were
satisfied that there was a restless little animal inside the case, who
worked twenty-four hours a day at turning the hands. If the hands
stopped going, you said: 'It is because the little animal is dead.'
Yet possibly he was only asleep.</p>

<p>"It has since been explained to you that a watch contains an
assemblage of parts well fitted to each other and kept well oiled,
which, being wound, can be considered to move spontaneously in a
perfect correspondence. If a spring become broken, if a bit of the
wheel work be injured, or if a grain of sand insinuate itself between
two of the parts, the watch stops, and the children say rightly: 'The
little animal is dead.' But suppose a sound watch, well made, right in
every particular, and stopped because the machinery would not run from
lack of oil; the little animal is not dead; nothing but a little oil
is needed to wake him up.</p>

<p>"Here is a first-rate chronometer, made in London. It runs fifteen
days without being wound.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20"
id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> I gave it a turn of the key yesterday:
it has, then, thirteen days to run. If I throw it on the ground, or if
I break the main-spring, all is over. I will have killed the little
animal. But suppose that, without damaging anything, I find means to
withdraw or dry up the fine oil which now enables the parts to slip
upon one another: will the little animal be dead? No! It will be
asleep. And the proof is that I can lay my watch in a drawer, keep it
there twenty-five years, and if, after a quarter of a century, I put a
drop of oil on it, the parts will begin to move again. All that time
would have passed without waking up the little sleeping animal. It
will still have thirteen days to go, after the time when it starts
again.</p>

<p>"All living beings, according to the opinion of Professor Meiser,
are watches, or organisms which move, breathe, nourish themselves, and
reproduce themselves as long as their organs are intact and properly
oiled. The oil of the watch is represented in the animal by an
enormous quantity of water. In man, for example, water provides about
four-fifths of the whole weight. Given&mdash;a colonel weighing a
hundred and fifty pounds, there are thirty pounds of colonel and a
hundred and twenty pounds, or about sixty quarts, of water. This is a
fact proven by numerous experiments. I say a colonel just as I would
say a king; all men are equal when submitted to analysis.</p>

<p>"Professor Meiser was satisfied, as are all
physiologists,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg
21]</a></span> that to break a colonel's head, or to make a hole in
his heart, or to cut his spinal column in two, is to kill the little
animal; because the brain, the heart, the spinal marrow are the
indispensable springs, without which the machine cannot go. But he
thought too, that in removing sixty quarts of water from a living
person, one merely puts the little animal to sleep without killing
him&mdash;that a colonel carefully dried up, can remain preserved a
hundred years, and then return to life whenever any one will replace
in him the drop of oil, or rather the sixty quarts of water, without
which the human machine cannot begin moving again.</p>

<p>"This opinion, which may appear inadmissible to you and to me too,
but which is not absolutely rejected by our friend Doctor Martout,
rests upon a series of reliable observations which the merest tyro can
verify to-day. There <i>are</i> animals which can be resuscitated:
nothing is more certain or better proven. Herr Meiser, like the
Abb&eacute; Spallanzani and many others, collected from the gutter of
his roof some little dried worms which were brittle as glass, and
restored life to them by soaking them in water. The capacity of thus
returning to life, is not the privilege of a single species: its
existence has been satisfactorily established in numerous and various
animals. The genus Volvox&mdash;the little worms or wormlets in
vinegar, mud, spoiled paste, or grain-smut; the Rotifera&mdash;a kind
of little shell-fish protected by a carapace, provided with a good
digestive apparatus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22"
id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> of separate sexes, having a nervous
system with a distinct brain, having either one or two eyes, according
to the genus, a crystalline lens, and an optic nerve; the
Tardigrades&mdash;which are little spiders with six or eight legs,
separate sexes, regular digestive apparatus, a mouth, two eyes, a very
well defined nervous system, and a very well developed muscular
system;&mdash;all these die and revive ten or fifteen times
consecutively, at the will of the naturalist. One dries up a rotifer:
good night to him; somebody soaks him a little, and he wakes up to bid
you good day. All depends upon taking great care while he is dry. You
understand that if any one should merely break his head, no drop of
water, nor river, nor ocean could restore him.</p>

<p>"The marvellous thing is, that an animal which cannot live more
than a year, like the minute worm in grain-smut, can lie by
twenty-four years without dying, if one has taken the precaution of
desiccating him.</p>

<p>"Needham collected a lot of them in 1743; he presented them to
Martin Folkes, who gave them to Baker, and these interesting creatures
revived in water in 1771. They enjoyed a rare satisfaction in elbowing
their own twenty-eighth generation. Wouldn't a man who should see his
own twenty-eighth generation be a happy grandfather?</p>

<p>"Another no less interesting fact is that desiccated animals have
vastly more tenacity of life than others. If the temperature were
suddenly to fall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23"
id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> thirty degrees in this laboratory, we
should all get inflammation of the lungs. If it were to rise as much,
there would be danger of congestion of the brain. Well, a desiccated
animal, which is not absolutely dead, and which will revive to-morrow
if I soak it, faces with impunity, variations of ninety-five degrees
and six-tenths. M. Meiser and plenty of others have proved it.</p>

<p>"It remains to inquire, then, if a superior animal, a man for
instance, can be desiccated without any more disastrous consequences
than a little worm or a tardigrade. M. Meiser was convinced that it is
practicable; he wrote to that effect in all his books, although he did
not demonstrate it by experiment.</p>

<p>"Now where would be the harm in it, ladies? All men curious in
regard to the future, or dissatisfied with life, or out of sorts with
their contemporaries, could hold themselves in reserve for a better
age, and we should have no more suicides on account of misanthropy.
Valetudinarians, whom the ignorant science of the nineteenth century
declares incurable, needn't blow their brains out any more; they can
have themselves dried up and wait peaceably in a box until Medicine
shall have found a remedy for their disorders. Rejected lovers need no
longer throw themselves into the river; they can put themselves under
the receiver of an air pump, and make their appearance thirty years
later, young, handsome and triumphant, satirizing the age of their
cruel charmers, and paying them back scorn
for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg
24]</a></span> scorn. Governments will give up the unnatural and
barbarous custom of guillotining dangerous people. They will no longer
shut them up in cramped cells at Mazas to complete their brutishness;
they will not send them to the Toulon school to finish their criminal
education; they will merely dry them up in batches&mdash;one for ten
years, another for forty, according to the gravity of their deserts. A
simple store-house will replace the prisons, police lock-ups and
jails. There will be no more escapes to fear, no more prisoners to
feed. An enormous quantity of dried beans and mouldy potatoes will be
saved for the consumption of the country.</p>

<p>"You have, ladies, a feeble delineation of the benefits which
Doctor Meiser hoped to pour upon Europe by introducing the desiccation
of man. He made his great experiment in 1813 on a French
colonel&mdash;a prisoner, I have been told, and condemned as a spy by
court-martial. Unhappily he did not succeed; for I bought the colonel
and his box for the price of an ordinary cavalry horse, in the
dirtiest shop in Berlin."</p>

<h3>THE VICTIM.</h3>


<p>"My dear Leon," said M. Renault, "you remind me of a college
commencement. We have listened to your dissertation just as they
listen to the Latin discourse of the professor of rhetoric; there are
always in the audience a majority which learns nothing from it, and a
minority which understands nothing of it. But every body listens
patiently, on account of the sensations which are to come by and by.
M. Martout and I are acquainted with Meiser's works, and those of his
distinguished pupil, M. Pouchet; you have, then, said too much that is
in them, if you intended to speak for our benefit; and you have not
said enough that is in them for these ladies and gentlemen who know
nothing of the existing discussions regarding the vital and organic
principles.</p>

<p>"Is life a principle of action which animates the organs and puts
them into play? Is it not, on the contrary, merely the result of
organization&mdash;the play of various functions of organized matter?
This is a problem of the highest importance, which would interest the
ladies themselves, if one were to place it plainly before them. It
would be sufficient to say:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26"
id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> 'We inquire whether there is a vital
principle&mdash;the source of all functions of the body, or if life be
not merely the result of the regular play of the organs? The vital
principle, in the eyes of Meiser and his disciple, does not exist; if
it really existed, they say, one could not understand how it can leave
a man and a tardigrade when they are desiccated, and return to them
again when they are soaked.' Now, if there be no vital principle, all
the metaphysical and moral theories which have been hypothecated on
its existence, must be reconstructed. These ladies have listened to
you patiently, it is but justice to them to admit; but all that they
have been able to gather from your slightly Latinish discourse, is
that you have given them a dissertation instead of the romance you
promised. But we all forgive you for the sake of the mummy you are
going to show us. Open the colonel's box."</p>

<p>"We've well earned the sight!" cried Clementine, laughing.</p>

<p>"But suppose you were to get frightened?"</p>

<p>"I'd have you know, sir, that I'm not afraid of anybody, not even
of live colonels!"</p>

<p>Leon took his bunch of keys and opened the long oak box on which he
had been seated. The lid being raised, they saw a great leaden casket
which enclosed a magnificent walnut box carefully polished on the
outside, and lined on the inside with white silk, and padded. The
others brought their lamps and candles near, and the colonel of the
23d of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg
27]</a></span> line appeared as if he were in a chapel illuminated for
his lying in state.</p>

<p>One would have said that the man was asleep. The perfect
preservation of the body attested the paternal care of the murderer.
It was truly a remarkable preparation, and would have borne comparison
with the finest European mummies described by Vicq d'Azyr in 1779, and
by the younger Puymaurin in 1787.</p>

<p>The part best preserved, as is always the case, was the face. All
the features had maintained a proud and manly expression. If any old
friend of the colonel had been present at the opening of the third
box, he would have recognized him at first sight.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the point of the nose was a little sharper, the
nostrils less expanded and thinner, and the bridge a little more
marked than in the year 1813. The eyelids were thinned, the lips
pinched, the corners of the mouth drawn down, the cheek bones too
prominent, and the neck visibly shrunken, which exaggerated the
prominence of the chin and larynx. But the eyelids were closed without
contraction, and the sockets much less hollow than one could have
expected; the mouth was not at all distorted like the mouth of a
corpse; the skin was slightly wrinkled but had not changed color; it
had only become a little more transparent, showing, after a fashion,
the color of the tendons, the fat and the muscles, wherever it rested
directly upon them. It also had a rosy tint which is not ordinarily
seen in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg
28]</a></span> embalmed corpses. Doctor Martout explained this anomaly
by saying that if the colonel had actually been dried alive, the
globules of the blood were not decomposed, but simply collected in the
capillary vessels of the skin and subjacent tissues where they still
preserved their proper color, and could be seen more easily than
otherwise, on account of the semi-transparency of the skin.</p>

<p>The uniform had become much too large, as may be readily
understood; though it did not seem, at a casual glance, that the
members had become deformed. The hands were dry and angular, but the
nails, although a little bent inward toward the root, had preserved
all their freshness. The only very noticeable change was the excessive
depression of the abdominal walls, which seemed crowded downward
toward the posterior side; at the right, a slight elevation indicated
the place of the liver. A tap of the finger on the various parts of
the body, produced a sound like that from dry leather. While Leon was
pointing out these details to his audience and doing the honors of his
mummy he awkwardly broke off the lower part of the right ear, and a
little piece of the Colonel remained in his hand.</p>

<p>This trifling accident might have passed unnoticed, had not
Clementine, who followed with visible emotion all the movements of her
lover, dropped her candle and uttered a cry of affright. All gathered
around her. Leon took her in his arms and carried her to a chair. M.
Renault ran after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29"
id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> salts. She was as pale as death, and
seemed on the point of fainting.</p>

<p>She soon recovered, however, and reassured them all by a charming
smile.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," she said, "for such a ridiculous exhibition of terror;
but what Monsieur Leon was saying to us ... and then ... that figure
which seemed sleeping ... it appeared to me that the poor man was
going to open his mouth and cry out when he was injured."</p>

<p>Leon hastened to close the walnut box, while M. Martout picked up
the piece of ear and put it in his pocket. But Clementine, while
continuing to smile and make apologies, was overcome by a fresh
accession of emotion and melted into tears. The engineer threw himself
at her feet, poured forth excuses and tender phrases, and did all he
could to console her inexplicable grief. Clementine dried her eyes,
looked prettier than ever, and sighed fit to break her heart, without
knowing why.</p>

<p>"Beast that I am!" muttered Leon, tearing his hair. "On the day
when I see her again after three years' absence, I can think of
nothing more soul-inspiring than showing her mummies!" He launched a
kick at the triple coffin of the Colonel, saying: "I wish the devil
had the confounded Colonel!"</p>

<p>"No!" cried Clementine with redoubled energy and emotion. "Do not
curse him, Monsieur Leon! He has suffered so much! Ah! poor, poor
unfortunate man!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30"
id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Mlle. Sambucco felt a little ashamed. She made excuses for her
niece, and declared that never, since her tenderest childhood, had she
manifested such extreme sensitiveness. M. and Mme. Renault, who had
seen her grow up; Doctor Martout who had held the sinecure of
physician to her; the architect, the notary, in a word, everybody
present was plunged into a state of absolute stupefaction. Clementine
was no sensitive plant. She was not even a romantic school girl. Her
youth had not been nourished by Anne Radcliffe, she did not trouble
herself about ghosts, and she would go through the house very
tranquilly at ten o'clock at night without a candle. When her mother
died, some months before Leon's departure, she did not wish to have
any one share with her the sad satisfaction of watching and praying in
the death-chamber.</p>

<p>"This will teach us," said the aunt, "how to stay up after ten
o'clock. What! It is midnight, all to quarter of an hour! Come, my
child; you will get better fast enough after you get to bed."</p>

<p>Clementine arose submissively, but at the moment of leaving the
laboratory she retraced her steps, and with a caprice more
inexplicable than her grief, she absolutely wished to see the mummy of
the colonel again. Her aunt scolded in vain; in spite of the remarks
of Mlle. Sambucco and all the persons present, she reopened the walnut
box, kneeled down beside the mummy and kissed it on the
forehead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg
31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor man!" said she, rising, "How cold he is! Monsieur Leon,
promise me that if he is dead you will have him laid in consecrated
ground!"</p>

<p>"As you please, Mademoiselle. I had intended to send him to the
anthropological museum, with my father's permission; but you know that
we can refuse you nothing."</p>

<p>They did not separate as gaily, by a good deal, as they had met. M.
Renault and his son escorted Mlle. Sambucco and her niece to their
door, and met the big colonel of cuirassiers who had been honoring
Clementine with his attentions. The young girl tenderly pressed the
arm of her betrothed and said: "Here is a man who never sees me
without sighing. And what sighs! Gracious Heavens! It wouldn't take
more than two to fill the sails of a a ship. The race of colonels has
vastly degenerated since 1813. One doesn't see any more such fine
looking ones as our unfortunate friend."</p>

<p>Leon agreed with all she said. But he did not exactly see how he
had become the friend of a mummy for which he had just paid
twenty-five louis. To divert the conversation, he said to Clementine:
"I have not yet shown you all the nice things I brought. His majesty,
the Emperor of all the Russias, made me a present of a little
enamelled gold star hanging at the end of a ribbon. Do you like
button-hole ribbons?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" answered she, "the red ribbon of the Legion of Honor.
Did you notice? The poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32"
id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> colonel still has a shred of one on
his uniform, but the cross is there no longer. Those wicked Germans
tore it away from him when they took him prisoner!"</p>

<p>"It's very possible," said Leon.</p>

<p>When they reached Mlle. Sambucco's house, it was time to separate.
Clementine offered her hand to Leon, who would have been better
pleased with her cheek.</p>

<p>Father and son returned home arm in arm, with slow steps, giving
themselves up to endless conjectures regarding the whimsical emotions
of Clementine.</p>

<p>Mme. Renault was waiting to put her son to bed; a time-honored and
touching habit which mothers do not early lose. She showed him the
handsome apartment above the parlor and M. Renault's laboratory, which
had been prepared for his future domicile.</p>

<p>"You will be as snug in here as a little cock in a pie," said she,
showing him a bed-chamber fairly marvellous in its comfort. "All the
furniture is soft and rounded, without a single angle. A blind man
could walk here without any fear of hurting himself. See how I
understand domestic comfort! Why, each arm-chair can be a friend! This
will cost you a trifle. Penon Brothers came from Paris expressly. But
a man ought to be comfortable at home, so that he may have no
temptation to go abroad."</p>

<p>This sweet motherly prattle stretched itself
over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg
33]</a></span> two good hours, and much of it related to Clementine,
as you will readily suppose. Leon had found her prettier than he had
dreamed her in his sweetest visions, but less loving. "Devil take me!"
said he, blowing out his candle; "One might think that that confounded
stuffed Colonel had come to thrust himself between
us."</p>

<h3>DREAMS OF LOVE, AND OTHER DREAMS.</h3>


<p>Leon learned to his cost, that a good conscience and a good bed are
not enough to insure a good sleep. He was bedded like a sybarite,
innocent as an Arcadian shepherd, and, moreover, tired as a soldier
after a forced march; nevertheless a dull sleeplessness weighed upon
him until morning. In vain he tossed into every possible position, as
if to shift the burden from one shoulder on to the other. He did not
close his eyes until he had seen the first glimmering of dawn silver
the chinks of his shutters.</p>

<p>He lulled himself to sleep thinking of Clementine; an obliging
dream soon showed him the image of her he loved. He saw her in bridal
costume, in the chapel of the imperial chateau. She was leaning on the
arm of the elder M. Renault, who had put spurs on in honor of the
ceremony. Leon followed, having given his arm to Mlle. Sambucco; the
ancient maiden was decorated with the insignia of the Legion of Honor.
On approaching the altar, the bridegroom noticed that his father's
legs were as thin as broomsticks, and, when he was about expressing
his astonishment, M. Renault
turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg
35]</a></span> around and said to him: "They are thin because they are
desiccated; but they are not deformed." While he was giving this
explanation, his face altered, his features changed, he shot out a
black moustache, and grew terribly like the Colonel. The ceremony
began. The choir was filled with tardigrades and rotifers as large as
men and dressed like choristers: they intoned, in solemn measure, a
hymn of the German composer, Meiser, which began thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The vital principle<br></span>
<span class="i0">Is a gratuitous hypothesis!<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poetry and the music appeared admirable to Leon; he was trying
to impress them on his memory when the officiating priest advanced
toward him with two gold rings on a silver salver. This priest was a
colonel of cuirassiers in full uniform. Leon asked himself when and
where he had met him. It was on the previous evening before
Clementine's door. The cuirassier murmured these words: "The race of
colonels has vastly degenerated since 1813." He heaved a profound
sigh, and the nave of the chapel, which was a ship-of-the-line, was
driven over the water at a speed of forty knots. Leon tranquilly took
the little gold ring and prepared to place it on Clementine's finger,
but he perceived that the hand of his betrothed was dried up; the
nails alone had retained their natural freshness. He was frightened
and fled across the church, which he found filled with colonels of
every age and variety. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36"
id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> crowd was so dense that the most
unheard-of efforts failed to penetrate it. He escapes at last, but
hears behind him the hurried steps of a man who tries to catch him. He
doubles his speed, he throws himself on all-fours, he gallops, he
neighs, the trees on the way seem to fly behind him, he no longer
touches the earth. But the enemy comes up faster than the wind; Leon
hears the sound of his steps, his spurs jingle; he catches up with
Leon, seizes him by the mane, flings himself with a bound upon his
back, and goads him with the spur. Leon rears; the rider bends over
toward his ear and says, stroking him with his whip: "I am not heavy
to carry:&mdash;thirty pounds of colonel." The unhappy lover of Mlle.
Clementine makes a violent effort and springs sideways; the Colonel
falls and draws his sword. Leon loses no time; he puts himself on
guard and fights, but almost instantly feels the Colonel's sword enter
his heart to the hilt. The chill of the blade spreads further and
further, and ends by freezing Leon from head to foot. The Colonel
draws nearer and says, smiling: "The main-spring is broken; the little
animal is dead." He puts the body in the walnut box, which is too
short and too narrow. Cramped on every side, Leon struggles, strains
and wakes himself up, worn out with fatigue and half smothered between
the bed and the wall.</p>

<p>He quickly jumped into his slippers and eagerly raised the windows
and pushed open the shutters. "He made light, and saw that it was
good,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg

Brrroum! He shook off the recollections of his dream as a wet dog
shakes off drops of water. The famous London chronometer told him that
it was nine o'clock. A cup of chocolate, served by Gothon, helped not
a little to untangle his ideas. On proceeding with his toilet, in a
very bright, cheerful and convenient dressing-room, he reconciled
himself to the realities of life. "Everything considered," he said to
himself, combing out his yellow beard, "nothing but happiness has come
to me. Here I am in my native country, with my family and in a pretty
house which is our own. My father and mother are both well, and, for
myself, I revel in the most luxuriant health. Our fortune is moderate,
but so are our tastes, and we shall never feel the want of anything.
Our friends received me yesterday with open arms; and as for enemies
we have none. The prettiest girl in Fontainebleau is willing to become
my wife; I can marry her in less than three weeks if I see fit to
hurry things a little. Clementine did not meet me as if I were of no
interest to her; far from it. Her lovely eyes smiled upon me last
night with the most tender regard. It is true that she wept at the
end, that's too certain. That is my only vexation, my only anxiety,
the sole cause of that foolish dream I had last night. She did weep,
but why? Because I was beast enough to regale her with a lecture, and
that, too, about a mummy. All right! I'll have the mummy
buried;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg
38]</a></span> I'll hold back my dissertations, and nothing else in
the world will come to disturb our happiness."</p>

<p>He went down stairs, humming an air from the <i>Nozze</i>. M. and
Mme. Renault, who were not accustomed to going to bed after midnight,
were still asleep. On going into the laboratory, he saw that the
triple box of the Colonel was closed. Gothon had placed a little
wooden cross and a sprig of consecrated box on the cover. "We may as
well begin masses for his soul," he murmured between his teeth, with a
smile that might have been a little sceptical. At the same time he
noticed that Clementine, in her agitation, had forgotten the presents
he had brought her. He made a bundle of them, looked at his watch, and
concluded that there would be no indiscretion in straining a point to
go to Mlle. Sambucco's.</p>

<p>The much-to-be-respected aunt was an early riser, as they generally
are in the rural districts, and had, in fact, already gone out to
church, and Clementine was gardening near the house. She ran to her
lover without thinking of throwing down the little rake she held in
her hand, and with the sweetest smile in the world, held up her pretty
rosy cheeks which were a little moist and flushed by the pleasant
warmth of pleasure and exercise.</p>

<p>"Aren't you put out with me?" said she. "I was very ridiculous last
night. My aunt has scolded me in the bargain. And I forgot to take the
pretty things you brought me from among the
savages!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg
39]</a></span> But it was not from lack of appreciation. I am so happy
to see that you have always thought of me as I have thought of you! I
could have sent for them to-day, but I am pleasantly anticipated. My
heart told me that you would come yourself."</p>

<p>"Your heart knew me, dear Clementine."</p>

<p>"It would be very unfortunate if it did not know its owner."</p>

<p>"How good you are, and how much I love you!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I, too, dear Leon, I love you dearly."</p>

<p>She stood the rake against a tree, and hung upon the arm of her
intended husband with that supple and languishing grace, the secret of
which the creoles possess.</p>

<p>"Come this way" said she, "so that I can show you all the
improvements we have made in the garden."</p>

<p>Leon admired everything she wanted him to. The fact is that he had
eyes for nothing but her. The grotto of Polyphemus and the cave of
C&aelig;cus would have appeared to him pleasanter than the gardens of
Armida, if Clementine's little red jacket had been promenading in
them.</p>

<p>He asked her if she did not feel some regret in leaving so charming
a retreat, and one which she had embellished with so much care.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked she, without thinking to blush. "We will not go far
off, and, besides, won't we come here every
day?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg
40]</a></span></p>

<p>The coming marriage was a thing so well settled, that it had not
even been spoken of on the previous evening. Nothing remained to be
done but to publish the bans and fix the date. Clementine, simple and
honest heart, expressed herself without any false modesty concerning
an event so entirely expected, so natural and so agreeable. She had
expressed her tastes to Mme. Renault in the arrangement of the new
apartments, and chosen the hangings herself; and she no longer made
any ceremony in talking with her intended of the happy life in common
which was about beginning for them, of the people they would invite to
the marriage ceremony, of the wedding calls to be made afterwards, of
the day which should be appropriated for receptions and of the time
they would devote to each other's society and to work. She inquired in
regard to the occupation which Leon intended to make for himself, and
the hours which, of preference, he would give to study. This excellent
little woman would have been ashamed to bear the name of a sloth, and
unhappy in passing her days with an idler. She promised Leon in
advance, to respect his work as a sacred thing. On her part she
thoroughly intended to make her time also of use, and not to live with
folded arms. At the start she would take charge of the housekeeping,
under the direction of Madame Renault, who was beginning to find it a
little burdensome. And then would she not soon have children to care
for, bring up and educate? This was a noble and useful
pleas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg
41]</a></span>ure which she did not intend to share with any one.
Nevertheless she would send her sons to college, in order to fit them
for living in the world, and to teach them early those principles of
justice and equality which are the foundation of every good manly
character. Leon let her talk on, only interrupting her to agree with
her: for these two young people who had been educated and brought up
with the same ideas, saw everything with the same eyes. Education had
created this pleasant harmony rather than Love.</p>

<p>"Do you know" said Clementine, "that I felt an awful palpitation of
the heart when I entered the room where you were yesterday?"</p>

<p>"If you think that my heart beat less violently than
yours&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! but it was a different thing with me: I was afraid."</p>

<p>"What of?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid that I should not find you the same as I had seen you
in my thoughts. Remember that it had been three years since we bid
each other good bye. I remembered distinctly what you were when you
went away, and, with imagination helping memory a little, I had
reconstructed my Leon entire. But if you had no longer resembled him!
What would have become of me in the presence of a new Leon, when I had
formed the pleasant habit of loving the other?"</p>

<p>"You make me tremble. But your first greeting reassured me in
advance."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg
42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tut, sir! Don't speak of that first greeting, or you will make me
blush a second time. Let us speak rather of that poor colonel who made
me shed so many tears. How is he getting along this morning?"</p>

<p>"I forgot to inquire after his health, but if you want me
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's useless. You can announce to him a visit from me to-day. It
is absolutely necessary that I should see him this noon."</p>

<p>"You would be very sensible to give up this fancy. Why expose
yourself again to such painful emotions?"</p>

<p>"The fancy is stronger than I am. Seriously, dear Leon, the old
fellow attracts me."</p>

<p>"Why 'old fellow?' He has the appearance of a man who died when
from twenty-five to thirty years of age."</p>

<p>"Are you very sure that he is dead? I said 'old fellow' because of
a dream I had last night."</p>

<p>"Ha! You too?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You remember how agitated I was on leaving you, and,
moreover, I had been scolded by my aunt. And, too, I had been thinking
of terrible sights&mdash;my poor mother lying on her death-bed. In
fact, my spirits were quite broken down."</p>

<p>"Poor dear little heart!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, as I did not want to think about anything any more,
I went to bed quickly, and shut my eyes with all my might, so tightly,
indeed, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg
43]</a></span> I put myself to sleep. It was not long before I saw the
colonel. He was lying as I saw him in his triple coffin, but he had
long white hair and a most benign and venerable appearance. He begged
us to put him in consecrated ground, and we carried him, you and I, to
the Fontainebleau cemetery. On reaching my mother's tomb we saw that
the stone was displaced. My mother, in a white robe, was moved so as
to make a place beside her, and she seemed waiting for the colonel.
But every time we attempted to lay him down, the coffin left our hands
and rested suspended in the air, as if it had no weight. I could
distinguish the poor old man's features, for his triple coffin had
become as transparent as the alabaster lamp burning near the ceiling
of my chamber. He was sad, and his broken ear bled freely. All at once
he escaped from our hands, the coffin vanished, and I saw nothing but
him, pale as a statue, and tall as the tallest oaks of
the <i>bas-Breau</i>. His golden epaulettes spread out and became
wings, and he raised himself to heaven, holding over us both hands as
if in blessing. I woke up all in tears, but I have not told my dream
to my aunt, for she would have scolded me again."</p>

<p>"No one ought to be scolded but me, Clementine dear. It is my fault
that your gentle slumbers are troubled by visions of the other world.
But all this will be stopped soon: to-day I am going to seek a
definite receptacle for the
Colonel."</p>

<h3>A YOUNG GIRL'S CAPRICE.</h3>

<p>Clementine had a fresh young heart. Before knowing Leon, she had
loved but one person&mdash;her mother. No cousins of either sex, nor
uncles, nor aunts, nor grandfathers, nor grandmothers, had dissipated,
by dividing it among themselves, that little treasure of affection
which well-constituted children bring into the world. The grandmother,
Clementine Pichon, was married at Nancy in January, 1814, and died
three months later in the suburbs of Toulon, during her first
confinement. The grandfather, M. Langevin, a sub-commissary of the
first class, being left a widower, with a daughter in the cradle,
devoted himself to bringing up his child. He gave her, in 1835, to M.
Sambucco, an estimable and agreeable man, of Italian extraction, born
in France, and King's counsel in the court of Marseilles. In 1838 M.
Sambucco, who was a man of considerable independence, because he had
resources of his own, in some manner highly honorable to himself,
incurred the ill-will of the Keeper of the Seals. He was therefore
appointed Advocate-General to
Martinique,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg
45]</a></span> and after some days of hesitation, accepted the
transfer to that remote situation. But old M. Langevin did not easily
console himself for the departure of his daughter: he died two years
later without having embraced the little Clementine, to whom it was
intended that he should be godfather. M. Sambucco, his son-in-law,
lost his life in 1843, during an earthquake. The papers of the colony
and of the metropolis related at the time how he had fallen a victim
to his devotion to others. After this fearful misfortune, the young
widow hastened to recross the sea with her daughter. She settled in
Fontainebleau, in order that the child might live in a healthy
atmosphere. Fontainebleau is one of the healthiest places in France.
If Mme. Sambucco had been as good a manager as she was mother, she
would have left Clementine a respectable fortune, but she regulated
her affairs badly and got herself under heavy embarrassments. A
neighboring notary relieved her of a round sum; and two farms which
she had paid dearly for, brought her almost nothing. In short, she no
longer knew what her situation was, and began to lose all control of
it, when a sister of her husband, an old maid, pinched and pious,
expressed a desire to live with her and use their resources in common.
The arrival of this long-toothed spinster strangely frightened the
little Clementine, who hid herself under the furniture and nestled
among her mother's skirts; but it was the salvation of the house.
Mlle. Sambucco was not one of the most spirituelle
nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg
46]</a></span> one of the most romantic of women, but she was Order
incarnated. She reduced the expenses, handled the resources herself,
sold the two farms in 1847, bought some three-per-cents. in 1848, and
restored stable equilibrium in the budget. Thanks to the talents and
activity of this female steward, the gentle and improvident widow had
nothing to do but to fondle her child. Clementine learned to honor the
virtues of her aunt, but she adored her mother. When she had the
affliction of losing her, she found herself alone in the world,
leaning on Mlle. Sambucco, like a young plant on a prop of dry wood.
It was then that her friendship for Leon glimmered with a vague ray of
love; and young Renault profited by the necessity for expansion which
filled this youthful soul.</p>

<p>During the three long years that Leon spent away from her,
Clementine scarcely knew that she was alone. She loved and felt that
she was loved in return; she had faith in the future, and an inner
life of tenderness and timid hope; and this noble and gentle heart
required nothing more.</p>

<p>But what completely astonished her betrothed, her aunt and herself,
and strangely subverted all the best accredited theories respecting
the feminine heart,&mdash;what, indeed, reason would have refused to
credit had it not been established by facts, was that the day when she
again met the husband of her choice, an hour after she had thrown
herself into Leon's arms with a grace so full of trust,
Clementine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg
47]</a></span> was so abruptly invaded by a new sentiment which was
not love, nor friendship, nor fear, but transcended them all and spoke
with master tones in her heart.</p>

<p>From the instant when Leon had shown her the figure of the Colonel,
she had been seized by an actual passion for this nameless mummy. It
was nothing like what she felt towards young Renault, but it was a
combination of interest, compassion and respectful sympathy.</p>

<p>If any one had recounted some famous feat of arms, or some romantic
history of which the Colonel had been the hero, this impression would
have been natural, or, at least, explicable. But she knew nothing of
him except that he had been condemned as a spy by a council of war,
and yet she dreamed of him the very night after Leon's return.</p>

<p>This inexplicable prepossession at first manifested itself in a
religious form. She caused a mass to be said for the repose of the
Colonel's soul, and urged Leon to make preparations for the funeral,
herself selecting the ground in which he was to be interred. These
various cares never caused her to omit her daily visit to the walnut
box, or the respectful bending of the knee before the body, or the
sisterly or filial kiss which she regularly placed upon its forehead.
The Renault family soon became uneasy about such strange symptoms, and
hastened the interment of the attractive unknown, in order to relieve
themselves of him as soon as possible. But the day
be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg
48]</a></span>fore the one fixed for the ceremony, Clementine changed
her mind.</p>

<p>"By what right could they shut in the tomb a man who, possibly, was
not dead? The theories of the learned Doctor Meiser were not such that
one could reject them without examination. The matter was at least
worthy of a few days' reflection. Was it not possible to submit the
Colonel's body to some experiments? Professor Hirtz, of Berlin, had
promised to send some valuable documents concerning the life and death
of this unfortunate officer: nothing ought to be undertaken before
they were received; some one ought to write to Berlin to hasten the
sending of these papers."</p>

<p>Leon sighed, but yielded uncomplainingly to this new caprice, and
wrote to M. Hirtz.</p>

<p>Clementine found an ally in this second campaign in Doctor Martout.
Though he was but an average practitioner and disdained the
acquisition of practice far too much, M. Martout was not deficient in
knowledge. He had long been studying five or six great questions in
physiology, such as reanimation, spontaneous generation and the topics
connected with them. A regular correspondence kept him posted in all
recent discoveries; he was the friend of M. Pouchet, of Rouen; and
knew also the celebrated Karl Nibor, who has carried the use of the
microscope into researches so wide and so profound. M. Martout had
desiccated and resuscitated thousands of little worms, rotifers and
tardi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg
49]</a></span>grades; he held that life is nothing but organization in
action, and that the idea of reviving a desiccated man has nothing
absurd about it. He gave himself up to long meditations when Professor
Hirtz sent from Berlin the following document, the original of which
is filed among the manuscripts of the Humboldt
collection.</p>

<h3>PROFESSOR MEISER'S WILL IN FAVOR OF THE DESICCATED COLONEL.</h3>


<p>On this 20th day of January, 1824, being worn down by a cruel
malady and feeling the approach of the time when my person shall be
absorbed in the Great All;</p>

<p>I have written with my own hand this testament which is the
expression of my last will.</p>

<p>I appoint as executor my nephew Nicholas Meiser, a wealthy brewer
in the city of Dantzic.</p>

<p>I bequeath my books, papers and scientific collections of all
kinds, except item 3712, to my very estimable and learned friend, Herr
Von Humboldt.</p>

<p>I bequeath all the rest of my effects, real and personal, valued at
100,000 Prussian thalers or 375,000 francs, to Colonel Pierre Victor
Fougas, at present desiccated, but living, and entered in my catalogue
opposite No. 3712 (Zoology).</p>

<p>I trust that he will accept this feeble compensation for the
ordeals he has undergone in my laboratory, and the service he has
rendered to science.</p>

<p>Finally, in order that my nephew
Nicholas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg
51]</a></span> Meiser may exactly understand the duties I leave him to
perform, I have resolved to inscribe here a detailed account of the
desiccation of Colonel Fougas, my sole heir.</p>

<p>It was on the 11th of November in that unhappy year 1813, that my
relations with this brave young man began. I had long since quitted
Dantzic, where the noise of cannon and the danger from bombs had
rendered all labor impossible, and retired with my instruments and
books under the protection of the Allied Armies in the fortified town
of Liebenfeld. The French garrisons of Dantzic, Stettin, Custrin,
Glogau, Hamburg and several other German towns could not communicate
with each other or with their native land; meanwhile General Rapp was
obstinately defending himself against the English fleet and the
Russian army. Colonel Fougas was taken by a detachment of the Barclay
de Tolly corps, as he was trying to pass the Vistula on the ice, on
the way to Dantzic. They brought him prisoner to Liebenfeld on the
11th of November, just at my supper time, and Sergeant Garok, who
commanded in the village, forced me to be present at the examination
and act as interpreter.</p>

<p>The open countenance, manly voice, proud firmness and fine carriage
of the unfortunate young man won my heart. He had made the sacrifice
of his life. His only regret, he said, was having stranded so near
port, after passing through four armies; and being unable to carry out
the Emperor's orders. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52"
id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> appeared animated by that French
fanaticism which has done so much harm to our beloved Germany.
Nevertheless I could not help defending him; and I translated his
words less as an interpreter than as an advocate. Unhappily, they
found upon him a letter from Napoleon to General Rapp, of which I
preserved a copy:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Abandon Dantzic, break the blockade, unite with the
garrisons of Stettin, Custrin and Glogau, march along the Elbe,
arrange with St. Cyr and Davoust to concentrate the forces scattered
at Dresden, Forgau, Wittenberg, Magdeburg and Hamburg; roll up an army
like a snow ball; cross Westphalia, which is open, and come to defend
the line of the Rhine with an army of 170,000 Frenchmen which you will
have saved!</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Napoleon.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter was sent to the headquarters of the Russian army,
whilst a half-dozen illiterate soldiers, drunk with joy and bad
brandy, condemned the brave Colonel of the 23d of the line to the
death of a spy and a traitor. The execution was fixed for the next
day, the 12th, and M. Pierre Victor Fougas, after having thanked and
embraced me with the most touching sensibility, (He is a husband and a
father.) was shut up in the little battlemented tower of Liebenfeld,
where the wind whistles terribly through all the
loopholes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg
53]</a></span></p>

<p>The night of the 11th and 12th of November was one of the severest
of that terrible winter. My self-registering thermometer, which hung
outside my window with a southeast exposure, marked nineteen degrees
below zero, centigrade. I went early in the morning to bid the Colonel
a last farewell, and met Sergeant Garok, who said to me in bad
German:</p>

<p>"We won't have to kill the Frantzouski, he is frozen to death."</p>

<p>I ran to the prison. The colonel was lying on his back, rigid. But
I found after a few minutes' examination, that the rigidity of the
body was not that of death. The joints, though they had not their
ordinary suppleness, could be bent and extended without any great
effort. The limbs, the face, and the chest gave my hands a sensation
of cold, but very different from that which I had often experienced
from contact with corpses.</p>

<p>Knowing that he had passed several nights without sleep, and
endured extraordinary fatigues, I did not doubt that he had fallen
into that profound and lethargic sleep which is superinduced by
intense cold, and which if too far prolonged slackens respiration and
circulation to a point where the most delicate physiological tests are
necessary to discover the continuance of life. The pulse was
insensible; at least my fingers, benumbed with cold, could not feel
it. My hardness of hearing (I was then in my sixty-ninth year)
prevented my determining by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54"
id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> auscultation whether the beats of the
heart still aroused those feeble though prolonged vibrations which the
ear continues to hear some time after the hand fails to detect
them.</p>

<p>The colonel had reached that point of torpor produced by cold,
where to revive a man without causing him to die, requires numerous
and delicate attentions. Some hours after, congelation would
supervene, and with it, impossibility of restoration to life.</p>

<p>I was in the greatest perplexity. On the one hand I knew that he
was dying on my hands by congelation; on the other, I could not, by
myself, bestow upon him the attentions that were indispensable. If I
were to administer stimulants without having him, at the same time,
rubbed on the trunk and limbs by three or four vigorous assistants, I
would revive him only to see him die. I had still before my eyes the
spectacle of that lovely young girl asphyxiated in a fire, whom I
succeeded in reviving by placing burning coals under the clavicles,
but who could only call her mother, and died almost immediately, in
spite of the administration of internal stimulants and electricity for
inducing contractions of the diaphragm and heart.</p>

<p>And even if I should succeed in bringing him back to health and
strength, was not he condemned by court-martial? Did not humanity
forbid my rousing him from this repose akin to death, to deliver him
to the horrors of execution?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55"
id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>I must confess that in the presence of this organism where life was
suspended, my ideas on reanimation took, as it were, fresh hold upon
me. I had so often desiccated and revived beings quite elevated in the
animal scale, that I did not doubt the success of the operation, even
on a man. By myself alone I could not revive and save the Colonel; but
I had in my laboratory, all the instruments necessary to desiccate him
without assistance.</p>

<p>To sum up, three alternatives offered themselves to me. I. To leave
the Colonel in the crenellated tower, where he would have died the
same day of congelation. II. To revive him by stimulants, at the risk
of killing him. And for what? To give him up, in case of success, to
inevitable execution. III. To desiccate him in my laboratory with the
quasi certainty of resuscitating him after the restoration of peace.
All friends of humanity will doubtless comprehend that I could not
hesitate long.</p>

<p>I had Sergeant Garok called, and I begged him to sell me the body
of the Colonel. It was not the first time that I had bought a corpse
for dissection, so my request excited no suspicion. The bargain
concluded, I gave him four bottles of kirsch-wasser, and soon two
Russian soldiers brought me Colonel Fougas on a stretcher.</p>

<p>As soon as I was alone with him, I pricked one of his fingers:
pressure forced out a drop of blood. To place it under a microscope
between two plates of glass was the work of a minute. Oh, joy!
The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg
56]</a></span> fibrin was not coagulated. The red globules appeared
cleanly circular, flattened, biconcave, and without notches,
indentations or spheroidal swellings. The white globules changed their
shape, taking at intervals the spherical form, and varying their
shapes again by delicate expansions. I was not deceived then, it was a
torpid man that I had under my eyes, and not a dead one!</p>

<p>I placed him on a pair of scales. He weighed one hundred and forty
pounds, clothing included. I did not care to undress him, for I had
noticed that animals desiccated directly in contact with the air, died
oftener than those which remained covered with moss and other soft
materials, during the ordeal of desiccation.</p>

<p>My great air-pump, with its immense platform, its enormous oval
wrought-iron receiver, which a rope running on a pulley firmly fixed
in the ceiling easily raised and lowered by means of a
windlass&mdash;all these thousand and one contrivances which I had so
laboriously prepared in spite of the railleries of those who envied
me, and which I felt desolate at seeing unemployed, were going to find
their use! Unexpected circumstances had arisen at last to procure me
such a subject for experiment, as I had in vain endeavored to procure,
while I was attempting to reduce to torpidity dogs, rabbits, sheep and
other mammals by the aid of freezing mixtures. Long ago, without
doubt, would these results have been attained if I had been aided by
those who surround<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57"
id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>ed me, instead of being made the butt
of their railleries; if our authorities had sustained me with their
influence instead of treating me as a subversive spirit.</p>

<p>I shut myself up <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with the
Colonel, and took care that even old Getchen, my housekeeper, now
deceased, should not trouble me during my work. I had substituted for
the wearisome lever of the old fashioned air-pumps, a wheel arranged
with an eccentric which transformed the circular movement of the axis
into the rectilinear movement required by the pistons: the wheel, the
eccentric, the connecting rod, and the joints of the apparatus all
worked admirably, and enabled me to do everything by myself. The cold
did not impede the play of the machine, and the lubricating oil was
not gummed: I had refined it myself by a new process founded on the
then recent discoveries of the French <i>savant</i> M. Chevreul.</p>

<p>Having extended the body on the platform of the air-pump, lowered
the receiver and luted the rim, I undertook to submit it gradually to
the influence of a dry vacuum and cold. Capsules filled with chloride
of calcium were placed around the Colonel to absorb the water which
should evaporate from the body, and to promote the desiccation.</p>

<p>I certainly found myself in the best possible situation for
subjecting the human body to a process of gradual desiccation without
sudden interruption of the functions, or disorganization of the
tissues or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg
58]</a></span> fluids. Seldom had my experiments on rotifers and
tardigrades been surrounded with equal chances of success, yet they
had always succeeded. But the particular nature of the subject and the
special scruples imposed upon my conscience, obliged me to employ a
certain number of new conditions, which I had long since, in other
connections, foreseen the expediency of. I had taken the pains to
arrange an opening at each end of my oval receiver, and fit into it a
heavy glass, which enabled me to follow with my eye the effects of the
vacuum on the Colonel. I was entirely prevented from shutting the
windows of my laboratory, from fear that a too elevated temperature
might put an end to the lethargy of the subject, or induce some change
in the fluids. If a thaw had come on, all would have been over with my
experiment. But the thermometer kept for several days between six and
eight degrees below zero, and I was very happy in seeing the lethargic
sleep continue, without having to fear congelation of the tissues.</p>

<p>I commenced to produce the vacuum with extreme slowness, for fear
that the gases distributed through the blood, becoming free on account
of the difference of their tension from that of rarified air, might
escape in the vessels and so bring on immediate death. Moreover, I
watched, every moment, the effects of the vacuum on the intestinal
gases, for by expanding inside in proportion as the pressure of the
air diminished outside of the body, they could have
caused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg
59]</a></span> serious disorders. The tissues might not have been
entirely ruptured by them, but an internal lesion would have been
enough to occasion death in a few hours after reanimation. One
observes this quite frequently in animals carelessly desiccated.</p>

<p>Several times, too rapid a protrusion of the abdomen put me on my
guard against the danger which I feared, and I was obliged to let in a
little air under the receiver. At last, the cessation of all phenomena
of this kind satisfied me that the gases had disappeared by exosmose
or had been expelled by the spontaneous contraction of the viscera. It
was not until the end of the first day that I could give up these
minute precautions, and carry the vacuum a little further.</p>

<p>The next day, the 13th, I pushed the vacuum to a point where the
barometer fell to five millimetres. As no change had taken place in
the position of the body or limbs, I was sure that no convulsion had
been produced. The colonel had been desiccated, had become immobile,
had lost the power of performing the functions of life, without death
having supervened, and without the possibility of returning to
activity having departed. His life was suspended, not
extinguished.</p>

<p>Each time that a surplus of watery vapor caused the barometer to
ascend, I pumped. On the 14th, the door of my laboratory was literally
broken in by the Russian General, Count Trollohub, who had been sent
from headquarters. This distinguished
officer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg
60]</a></span> had run in all haste to prevent the execution of the
colonel and to conduct him into the presence of the Commander in
Chief. I loyally confessed to him what I had done under the
inspiration of my conscience; I showed him the body through one of the
bull's-eyes of the air-pump; I told him that I was happy to have
preserved a man who could furnish useful information to the liberators
of my country; and I offered to resuscitate him at my own expense if
they would promise me to respect his life and liberty. The General,
Count Trollohub, unquestionably a distinguished man, but one of an
exclusively military education, thought that I was not speaking
seriously. He went out slamming the door in my face, and treating me
like an old fool.</p>

<p>I set myself to pumping again, and kept the vacuum at a pressure of
from three to five millimetres for the space of three months. I knew
by experience that animals can revive after being submitted to a dry
vacuum and cold for eighty days.</p>

<p>On the 12th of February 1814, having observed that for a month no
modification had taken place in the shrinking of the flesh, I resolved
to submit the Colonel to another series of operations, in order to
insure more perfect preservation by complete desiccation. I let the
air re-enter by the stop-cock arranged for the purpose, and, after
raising the receiver, proceeded at once to my experiment.</p>

<p>The body did not weigh more than forty-six pounds; I had then
reduced it nearly to a third<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61"
id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> of its original weight. It should be
borne in mind that the clothing had not lost as much water as the
other parts. Now the human body contains nearly four-fifths of its own
weight of water, as is proved by a desiccation thoroughly made in a
chemical drying furnace.</p>

<p>I accordingly placed the Colonel on a tray, and, after sliding it
into my great furnace, gradually raised the temperature to 75 degrees,
centigrade. I did not dare to go beyond this heat, from fear of
altering the albumen and rendering it insoluble, and also of taking
away from the tissues the capacity of reabsorbing the water necessary
to a return to their functions.</p>

<p>I had taken care to arrange a convenient apparatus so that the
furnace was constantly traversed by a current of dry air. This air was
dried in traversing a series of jars filled with sulphuric acid,
quick-lime and chloride of calcium.</p>

<p>After a week passed in the furnace, the general appearance of the
body had not changed, but its weight was reduced to forty pounds,
clothing included. Eight days more brought no new decrease of weight.
From this, I concluded that the desiccation was sufficient. I knew
very well that corpses mummified in church vaults for a century or
more, end by weighing no more than a half-score of pounds, but they do
not become so light without a material alteration in their
tissues.</p>

<p>On the 27th of February, I myself placed
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg
62]</a></span> colonel in the boxes which I had had made for his
occupancy. Since that time, that is to say during a space of nine
years and eleven months, we have never been separated. I carried him
with me to Dantzic. He stays in my house. I have never placed him,
according to his number, in my zoological collection; he remains by
himself, in the chamber of honor. I do not grant any one the pleasure
of re-using his chloride of calcium. I will take care of you till my
dying day, Oh Colonel Fougas, dear and unfortunate friend! But I shall
not have the joy of witnessing your resurrection. I shall not share
the delightful emotions of the warrior returning to life. Your
lachrymal glands, inert to-day, but some day to be reanimated, will
not pour upon the bosom of your old benefactor, the sweet dew of
recognition. For you will not recover your life until a day when mine
will have long since departed! Perhaps you will be astonished that I,
loving you as I do, should have so long delayed to draw you out of
this profound slumber. Who knows but that some bitter reproach may
come to taint the tenderness of the first offices of gratitude that
you will perform over my tomb! Yes! I have prolonged, without any
benefit to you, an experiment of general interest to others. I ought
to have remained faithful to my first intention, and restored your
life, immediately after the signature of peace. But what! Was it well
to send you back to France when the sun of your fatherland was
obscured by our soldiers and allies? I have spared you
that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg
63]</a></span> spectacle&mdash;one so grievous to such a soul as
yours. Without doubt you would have had, in March, 1815, the
consolation of again seeing that fatal man to whom you had consecrated
your devotion; but are you entirely sure that you would not have been
swallowed up with his fortune, in the shipwreck of Waterloo?</p>

<p>For five or six years past, it has not been your welfare nor even
the welfare of science, that prevented me from reanimating you, it has
been.... Forgive me, Colonel, it has been a cowardly attachment to
life. The disorder from which I am suffering, and which will soon
carry me off, is an aneurism of the heart; violent emotions are
interdicted to me. If I were myself to undertake the grand operation
whose process I have traced in a memorandum annexed to this
instrument, I would, without any doubt, succumb before finishing it;
my death would be an untoward accident which might trouble my
assistants and cause your resuscitation to fail.</p>

<p>Rest content! You will not have long to wait, and, moreover, what
do you lose by waiting? You do not grow old, you are always
twenty-four years of age; your children are growing up, you will be
almost their contemporary when you come to life again. You came to
Liebenfeld poor, you are now in my house poor, and my will makes you
rich. That you may be happy also, is my dearest wish.</p>

<p>I direct that, the day after my death, my
nephew,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg
64]</a></span> Nicholas Meiser, shall call together, by letter, the
ten physicians most illustrious in the kingdom of Prussia, that he
shall read to them my will and the annexed memorandum, and that he
shall cause them to proceed without delay, in my own laboratory, to
the resuscitation of Colonel Fougas. The expenses of travel,
maintenance, etc., etc., shall be deducted from the assets of my
estate. The sum of two thousand thalers shall be devoted to the
publication of the glorious results of the experiment, in German,
French and Latin. A copy of this pamphlet shall be sent to each of the
learned societies then existing in Europe.</p>

<p>In the entirely unexpected event of the efforts of science being
unable to reanimate the Colonel, all my effects shall revert to
Nicholas Meiser, my sole surviving relative.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>HOW NICHOLAS MEISER, NEPHEW OF JOHN MEISER, EXECUTED HIS UNCLE'S
WILL.</h3

<p>Doctor Hirtz of Berlin, who had copied this will himself,
apologized very politely for not having sent it sooner. Business had
obliged him to travel away from the Capital. In passing through
Dantzic, he had given himself the pleasure of visiting Herr Nicholas
Meiser, the former brewer, now a very wealthy land-owner and heavy
holder of stocks, sixty-six years of age. This old man very well
remembered the death and will of his uncle, the <i>savant</i>; but he
did not speak of them without a certain reluctance. Moreover, he said
that immediately after the decease of John Meiser, he had called
together ten physicians of Dantzic around the mummy of the Colonel; he
showed also a unanimous statement of these gentlemen, affirming that a
man desiccated in a furnace cannot in any way or by any means return
to life. This certificate, drawn up by the professional competitors
and enemies of the deceased, made no mention of the paper annexed to
the will. Nicholas Meiser swore by all the Gods (but not without
visibly coloring) that this
document<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg
66]</a></span> concerning the methods to be pursued in resuscitating
the Colonel, had never been known by himself or his wife. When
interrogated regarding the reasons which could have brought him to
part with a trust as precious as the body of M. Fougas, he said that
he had kept it in his house fifteen years with every imaginable
respect and care, but that at the end of that time, becoming beset
with visions and being awakened almost every night by the Colonel's
ghost coming and pulling at his feet, he concluded to sell it for
twenty crowns to a Berlin amateur. Since he had been rid of this
dismal neighbor, he had slept a great deal better, but not entirely
well yet; for it had been impossible for him to forget the apparition
of the Colonel.</p>

<p>To these revelations, Herr Hirtz, physician to His Royal Highness
the Prince Regent of Prussia, added some remarks of his own. He did
not think that the resuscitation of a healthy man, desiccated with
precaution, was impossible in theory; he thought also, that the
process of desiccation indicated by the illustrious John Meiser was
the best to follow. But in the present case, it did not appear to him
probable that Colonel Fougas could be called back to life; the
atmospheric influences and the variations of temperature which he had
undergone during a period of forty six years, must have altered the
fluids and the tissues.</p>

<p>This was also the opinion of M. Renault and his son. To quiet
Clementine's excitement a little,
they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg
67]</a></span> read to her the concluding paragraphs of Prof. Hirtz'
letter. They kept from her John Meiser's will, which could have done
nothing but excite her. But the little imagination worked on without
cessation, do what they would to quiet it. Clementine now sought the
company of Doctor Martout, she held discussions with him and wanted to
see experiments in the resuscitation of rotifers. When she got home
again, she would think a little about Leon and a great deal about the
Colonel. The project of marriage was still entertained, but no one
ventured to speak about the publication of the bans. To the most
touching endearments of her betrothed, the young fianc&eacute;e
responded with disquisitions on the vital principle. Her visits to the
Renaults' house were paid less to the living than to the dead. All the
arguments they put in use to cure her of a foolish hope served only to
throw her into a profound melancholy. Her beautiful complexion grew
pale, the brilliancy of her glance died away. Undermined by a hidden
disorder, she lost the amiable vivacity which had appeared to be the
sparkling of youth and joy. The change must have been very noticeable,
for even Mlle. Sambucco, who had not a mother's eyes, was troubled
about it.</p>

<p>M. Martout, satisfied that this malady of the spirit would not
yield to any but a moral treatment, came to see her one morning, and
said:</p>

<p>"My dear child, although I cannot well explain to myself the great
interest that you take in this mummy, I have done something for it and
for you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg
68]</a></span> I am going to send the little piece of ear that Leon
broke off to M. Karl Nibor."</p>

<p>Clementine opened all her eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't you understand me?" continued the Doctor. "The thing is, to
find out whether the humors and tissues of the Colonel have undergone
material alterations. M. Nibor, with his microscope, will tell us the
state of things. One can rely upon him: he is an infallible genius.
His answer will tell us if it be well to proceed to the resuscitation
of our man, or whether nothing is left but to bury him."</p>

<p>"What!" cried the young girl. "One can tell whether a man is dead
or living, by sample?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more is required by Doctor Nibor. Forget your anxieties,
then, for a week. As soon as the answer comes, I will give it to you
to read. I have stimulated the curiosity of the great physiologist: he
knows absolutely nothing about the fragment I send him. But if, to
suppose an impossibility, he tells us that the piece of ear belongs to
a sound being, I will beg him to come to Fontainebleau and help us
restore his life."</p>

<p>This vague glimmer of hope dissipated Clementine's melancholy, and
brought back her buoyant health. She again began to sing and laugh and
flutter about the garden at her aunt's, and the house at M. Renault's.
The tender communings began again, the wedding was once more talked
over, and the first ban was published.</p>

<p>"At last," said Leon, "I have found her
again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg
69]</a></span></p>

<p>But Madame Renault, that wise and cautious mother, shook her head
sadly.</p>

<p>"All this goes but half well," said she. "I do not like to have my
daughter-in-law so absorbed with that handsome dried-up fellow. What
are we to expect when she knows that it is impossible to bring him to
life again? Will the black butterflies<a name="FNanchor_1_1"
id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[1]</sup></a>then fly away? And suppose they
happen, by a miracle, to reanimate him! are you sure she will not fall
in love with him? Indeed, Leon must have thought it very necessary to
buy this mummy, and I call it money well invested!"</p>

<p>One Sunday morning M. Martout rushed in upon the old professor,
shouting victory.</p>

<p>Here is the answer which had come to him from Paris:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"My dear <i>confr&egrave;re</i>:</p>

<p>"I have received your letter, and the little fragment of tissue
whose nature you asked me to determine. It did not cost me much
trouble to find out the matter in question, I have done more difficult
things twenty times, in the course of experiments relating to medical
jurisprudence. You could have saved yourself the use of the
established formula: "When you shall have made your microscopic
examination, I will tell you what it is." These little tricks amount
to nothing: my microscope knows better than you do what you have sent
me. You know the form and color of things: <i>it</i> sees their inmost
nature, the laws of their being, the conditions of their life and
death.</p>

<p>"Your fragment of desiccated matter, half as broad as my nail and
nearly as thick, after remaining for twenty-four hours under a
bell-glass in an atmosphere saturated with water at the
temperature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg
70]</a></span> of the human body, became supple&mdash;so much so as to
be a little elastic. I could consequently dissect it, study it like a
piece of fresh flesh, and put under the microscope each one of its
parts that appeared different, in consistency or color, from the
rest.</p>

<p>"I at once found, in the middle, a slight portion harder and more
elastic than the rest, which presented the texture and cellular
structure of cartilage. This was neither the cartilage of the nose,
nor the cartilage of an articulation, but certainly the
fibro-cartilage of the ear. You sent me, then, the end of an ear, and
it is not the lower end&mdash;the lobe which women pierce to put their
gold ornaments in, but the upper end, into which the cartilage
extends.</p>

<p>"On the inner-side, I took off a fine skin, in which the microscope
showed me an epidermis, delicate, perfectly intact; a derma no less
intact, with little papill&aelig; and, moreover, covered with a lot of
fine human hairs. Each of these little hairs had its root imbedded in
its follicle, and the follicle accompanied by its two little glands. I
will tell you even more: these hairs of down were from four to five
millimetres long, by from three to five hundredths of a millimetre in
diameter; this is twice the size of the pretty down which grows on a
feminine ear; from which I conclude that your piece of ear belongs to
a man.</p>

<p>"Against the curved edge of the cartilage, I found delicate
striated bunches of the muscle of the helix, and so perfectly intact
that one would have said there was nothing to prevent their
contracting. Under the skin and near the muscles, I found several
little nervous filaments, each one composed of eight or ten tubes in
which the medulla was as intact and homogeneous as in nerves removed
from a living animal or taken from an amputated limb. Are you
satisfied? Do you cry mercy? Well! As for me, I am not yet at the end
of my string.</p>

<p>"In the cellular tissue interposed between the cartilage and the
skin, I found little arteries and little veins whose structure was
perfectly cognizable. They contained some serum with red blood
globules. These globules were all of them circular, biconcave and
perfectly regular; they showed neither indentations nor
that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg
71]</a></span> raspberry-like appearance which characterizes the blood
globules of a corpse.</p>

<p>"To sum up, my dear <i>confr&egrave;re</i>, I have found in this
fragment nearly everything that is found in the human
body&mdash;cartilage, muscle, nerve, skin, hairs, glands, blood, etc.,
and all this in a perfectly healthy and normal state. It is not, then,
a piece of a corpse which you sent me, but a piece of a living man,
whose humors and tissues are in no way decomposed.</p>

<p>"With high consideration, yours, </p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Karl Nibor.</span><br> <br>

<h3>CONSIDERABLE OF A DISTURBANCE IN FONTAINEBLEAU.</h3>

<p>It did not take long to get spread about the town that M. Martout
and the Messieurs Renault, intended, in conjunction with several Paris
<i>savans</i>, to resuscitate a dead man.</p>

<p>M. Martout had sent a detailed account of the case to the
celebrated Karl Nibor, who had hastened to lay it before the
Biological Society. A committee was forthwith appointed to accompany
M. Nibor to Fontainebleau. The six commissioners and the reporter
agreed to leave Paris the 15th of August,<a name="FNanchor_2_2"
id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[2]</sup></a> being glad to escape the din of
the public rejoicings. M. Martout was notified to get things ready for
the experiment, which would probably last not less than three
days.</p>

<p>Some of the Paris papers announced this great event among their
"Miscellaneous Items," but the public paid little attention to it. The
grand reception of the army returning from Italy engrossed everybody's
interest, and moreover, the French do not put more than moderate faith
in miracles promised in the
newspapers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg
73]</a></span></p>

<p>But at Fontainebleau, it was an entirely different matter. Not only
Monsieur Martout and the Messieurs Renault, but M. Audret, the
architect, M. Bonnivet, the notary, and a dozen other of the bigwigs
of the town, had seen and touched the mummy of the Colonel. They had
spoken about it to their friends, had described it to the best of
their ability, and had recounted its history. Two or three copies of
Herr Meiser's will were circulating from hand to hand. The question of
reanimations was the order of the day; they discussed it around the
fish-pond, like the Academy of Sciences at a full meeting. Even in the
market-place you could have heard them talking about rotifers and
tardigrades.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the resuscitationists were not in the
majority. A few professors of the college, noted for the paradoxical
character of their minds; a few lovers of the marvellous, who had been
duly convicted of table-tipping; and, to top off with a half dozen of
those old white-moustached grumblers who believe that the death of
Napoleon I. is a calumnious lie set afloat by the English, constituted
the whole of the army. M. Martout had against him not only the
skeptics, but the innumerable crowd of believers, in the bargain. One
party turned him to ridicule, the others proclaimed him revolutionary,
dangerous, and an enemy of the fundamental ideas on which society
rests. The minister of one little church preached, in inuendoes,
against the Prometheuses who aspired to usurp the
prerog<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg
74]</a></span>atives of Heaven. But the rector of the parish did not
hesitate to say, in five or six houses, that the cure of a man as
desperately sick as M. Fougas, would be an evidence of the power and
mercy of God.</p>

<p>The garrison of Fontainebleau was at that time composed of four
squadrons of cuirassiers and the 23d regiment of the line, which had
distinguished itself at Magenta. As soon as it was known in Colonel
Fougas' old regiment that that illustrious officer was possibly going
to return to the world, there was a general sensation. A regiment
knows its history, and the history of the 23d had been that of Fougas
from February, 1811, to November, 1813. All the soldiers had heard
read, at their messes, the following anecdote:</p>

<p>"On the 27th of August, 1813, at the battle of Dresden, the Emperor
noticed a French regiment at the foot of a Russian redoubt which was
pouring grape upon it. He asked what regiment it was, and was told
that it was the 23d of the line. 'That's impossible!' said he. 'The
23d of the line never stood under fire without rushing upon the
artillery thundering at it.' At that moment the 23d, led by Colonel
Fougas, rushed up the height at double quick, pinned the artillerists
to their guns, and took the redoubt."</p>

<p>The officers and soldiers, justly proud of this memorable action,
venerated, under the name of Fougas, one of the fathers of the
regiment. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg
75]</a></span> idea of seeing him appear in the midst of them, young
and living, did not appear likely, but it was already something to be
in possession of his body. Officers and soldiers decided that he
should be interred at their expense, after the experiments of Doctor
Martout were completed. And to give him a tomb worthy of his glory,
they voted an assessment of two days' pay.</p>

<p>Every one who wore an epaulette visited M. Renault's laboratory;
the Colonel of cuirassiers went there several times&mdash;in hopes of
meeting Clementine. But Leon's betrothed kept herself out of the
way.</p>

<p>She was happier than any woman had ever been, this pretty little
Clementine. No cloud longer disturbed the serenity of her fair brow.
Free from all anxieties, with a heart opened to Hope, she adored her
dear Leon, and passed her days in telling him so. She herself had
pressed the publication of the bans.</p>

<p>"We will be married," said she, "the day after the resuscitation of
the Colonel. I intend that he shall give me away, I want him to bless
me. That is certainly the least he can do for me, after all I have
done for him. It is certain that, but for my opposition, you would
have sent him to the museum of the <i>Jardin des Plantes</i>. I will
tell him all this, Sir, as soon as he can understand us, and he will
cut <i>your</i> ears off, in <i>his</i> turn! I love you!"</p>

<p>"But," answered Leon, "why do you make
my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg
76]</a></span> happiness dependent on the success of an experiment?
All the usual formalities are executed, the publications made, the
notices given: no one in the world can prevent our marrying to-morrow,
and you are pleased to wait until the 19th! What connection is there
between us and this desiccated gentleman asleep in his box? He doesn't
belong to your family or mine. I have examined all your family records
back to the sixth generation, and I haven't found anybody of the name
of Fougas in them. So we are not waiting for a grandfather to be
present at the ceremony. Who is he, then? The wicked tongues of
Fontainebleau pretend that you have a <i>penchant</i> for this fetich
of 1813; as for me, who am sure of your heart, I trust that you will
never love any one as well as me. However they call me the rival of
the Sleeping Colonel in the Wood."</p>

<p>"Let the fools prate!" responded Clementine, with an angelic smile.
"I do not trouble myself to explain my affection for poor Fougas, but
I love him very much, that's certain. I love him as a father, as a
brother, if you prefer it, for he is almost as young as I. When we
have resuscitated him, I will love him, perhaps, as a son; but you
will lose nothing by it, dear Leon. You have in my heart a place by
itself, the best too, and no one shall take it from you, not
even <i>he</i>."</p>

<p>This lovers' quarrel, which often began, and always ended with a
kiss, was one day interrupted by a visit from the commissioner of
police.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg
77]</a></span></p>

<p>This honorable functionary politely declined to give his name and
business, and requested the favor of a private interview with young
Renault.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said he, when he saw him alone, "I appreciate all the
consideration due to a man of your character and position, and I hope
you will see fit not to interpret unpleasantly a proceeding which is
prompted in me by a sense of duty."</p>

<p>Leon opened his eyes and waited for the continuation of the
discourse.</p>

<p>"You are aware, Monsieur," pursued the Commissioner, "of what is
required by the law concerning interments. It is express, and admits
no exception. The authorities can keep their eyes shut, but the great
tumult that has arisen, and, moreover, the rank of the deceased,
without taking into account the religious considerations, put us under
obligation to proceed ... in conjunction with you, let it be well
understood...."</p>

<p>Leon comprehended little by little. The commissioner finished by
explaining to him, always in the administrative style, that it was
incumbent upon him to have M. Fougas taken to the town cemetery.</p>

<p>"But Monsieur," replied the engineer, "if you have heard people
speaking of Colonel Fougas, they ought to have told you withal that we
do not consider him dead."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" answered the Commissioner, with a slight smile.
"Opinions are free. But the
doctor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg
78]</a></span> whose office it is to attend to the disposition of the
dead, and who has had the pleasure of seeing the deceased, has made us
a conclusive report which points to immediate interment."</p>

<p>"Very well, Monsieur, if Fougas is dead, we are in hopes of
resuscitating him."</p>

<p>"So we have been told already Monsieur, but, for my part, I
hesitated to believe it."</p>

<p>"You will believe it when you have seen it; and I hope, Monsieur,
that that will be before long."</p>

<p>"But then, Monsieur, have you fixed everything in due form?"</p>

<p>"With whom?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, Monsieur, but I suppose that before undertaking
such a thing as this, you have fortified yourself with some legal
authorization."</p>

<p>"From whom?"</p>

<p>"But at all events, Monsieur, you admit that the reanimation of a
man is an extraordinary affair. As for myself, this is really the
first time that I ever heard it spoken of. Now the duty of a well
regulated police, is to prevent anything extraordinary happening in
the country."</p>

<p>"Let us see, Monsieur. If I were to say to you: 'Here is a man who
is not dead; I have a well-founded hope of setting him on his feet in
three days; your doctor, who maintains the contrary, deceives
himself,' would you take the responsibility of having Fougas
buried?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg
79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly not! God forbid that I should take any responsibility of
any kind on my shoulders! But however, Monsieur, in having M. Fougas
buried, I would act in accordance with law and order. Now after all,
by what right do you presume to resuscitate a man? In what country is
resuscitation customary? Where is the precept of law which authorizes
you to resuscitate people?"</p>

<p>"Do you know any law that prohibits it? Now everything that is not
prohibited is permitted."</p>

<p>"In the eyes of the magistrates, very likely. But the police ought
to prevent and stem disorder. Now a resuscitation, Monsieur, is a
thing so unheard of as to constitute an actual disorder."</p>

<p>"You will admit, nevertheless, that it is a very happy
disorder."</p>

<p>"There's no such thing as a happy disorder. Consider, moreover,
that the deceased is not a common sort of a man. If the question
concerned a vagabond without house or home, one could use some
tolerance in regard to it. But this is a soldier, an officer, of high
rank and decorated too; a man who has occupied an exalted position in
the army. The <i>army</i>, Monsieur! It will not do to touch the
army!"</p>

<p>"Eh! Monsieur, I touch the army like a surgeon who tends its
wounds. It is proposed to restore to the army a colonel. And you,
actuated by the spirit of routine, wish to rob it of one."</p>

<p>"Don't get so excited, Monsieur, I beg
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg
80]</a></span> you, and don't talk so loud: people can hear us.
Believe me, I will meet you half way in anything you want to do for
the great and glorious army of my country. But have you considered the
religious question?"</p>

<p>"What religious question?"</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, Monsieur (but this entirely between
ourselves), what we have spoken of so far is purely accessory and we
are now touching upon the delicate point. People have come to see me
and have made some very judicious remarks to me. The mere announcement
of your project has cast a good deal of trouble into certain
consciences. They fear that the success of an undertaking of this kind
may strike a blow at the faith, may, in a word, scandalize many
tranquil spirits. For, if M. Fougas is dead, of course it is because
God has so willed it. Aren't you afraid of acting contrary to the will
of God, in resuscitating him?"</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur: for I am sure not to resuscitate Fougas if God has
willed it otherwise; God permits a man to catch the fever, but God
also permits a doctor to cure him. God permitted a brave soldier of
the Emperor to be captured by four drunken Russians, condemned as a
spy, frozen in a fortress and desiccated under an air-pump by an old
German. But God also permitted me to find this unfortunate man in a
junk-shop, to carry him to Fontainebleau, to examine him with certain
men of science and to agree with them upon a method almost sure
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg
81]</a></span> restore him to life. All this proves one
thing&mdash;which is that God is more just, more merciful and more
inclined to pity than those who abuse his name in order to excite
you."</p>

<p>"I assure you, Monsieur, that I am not in the least excited. I
yield to your reasons because they are good ones and because you are a
man of consideration in the community. I sincerely hope, moreover,
that you will not think harshly of an act of zeal which I have been
advised to perform. I am a functionary, Monsieur. Now, what is a
functionary? A man who holds a place. Suppose now that functionaries
were to expose themselves to the loss of their places, what would
stand firm in France? Nothing, Monsieur, absolutely nothing. I have
the honor to bid you good day!"</p>

<p>On the morning of the 15th of August, M. Karl Nibor presented
himself at M. Renault's with Doctor Martont and the committee
appointed by the Biological Society of Paris. As often happens in the
rural districts the first appearance of our illustrious savant was a
sort of disappointment. Mme. Renault expected to see, if not a
magician in a velvet robe studded with gold, at least an old man of
extraordinarily grave and impressive appearance. Karl Nibor is a man
of middle height, very fair and very slight. Possibly he carries a
good forty years, but one would not credit him with more than
thirty-five. He wears a moustache and imperial; is lively, a good
conversationist, agreeable and enough of a man of
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg
82]</a></span> world to amuse the ladies. But Clementine did not have
the pleasure of his conversation. Her aunt had taken her to Moret in
order to remove her from the pangs of fear as well as from the
intoxications of victory.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>HALLELUJAH!</h3>


<p>M. Nibor and his colleagues, after the usual compliments, requested
to see the subject. They had no time to lose, as the experiment could
hardly last less than three days. Leon hastened to conduct them to the
laboratory and to open the three boxes containing the Colonel.</p>

<p>They found that the patient presented quite a favorable appearance.
M. Nibor took off his clothes, which tore like tinder from having been
too much dried in Father Meiser's furnace. The body, when naked, was
pronounced entirely free from blemish and in a perfectly healthy
condition. No one would yet have guaranteed success, but every one was
full of hope.</p>

<p>After this preliminary examination, M. Renault put his laboratory
at the service of his guests. He offered them all that he possessed,
with a munificence which was not entirely free from vanity. In case
the employment of electricity should appear necessary, he had a
powerful battery of Leyden jars
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg
84]</a></span> forty of Bunsen's elements, which were entirely new. M.
Nibor thanked him smilingly.</p>

<p>"Save your riches," said he. "With a bath-tub and caldron of
boiling water, we will have everything we need. The Colonel needs
nothing but humidity. The thing is to give him the quantity of water
necessary to the play of the organs. If you have a small room where
one can introduce a jet of vapor, we will be more than content.</p>

<p>M. Audret, the architect, had very wisely built a little bath-room
near the laboratory, which was convenient and well lighted. The
celebrated steam engine was not far off, and its boiler had not, up to
this time, answered any other purpose than that of warming the baths
of M. and Mme. Renault.</p>

<p>The Colonel was carried into this room, with all the care
necessitated by his fragility. It was not intended to break his second
ear in the hurry of moving. Leon ran to light the fire under the
boiler, and M. Nibor created him Fireman, on the field of battle.</p>

<p>Soon a jet of tepid vapor streamed into the bath-room, creating
around the Colonel a humid atmosphere which was elevated by degrees,
and without any sudden increase, to the temperature of the human body.
These conditions of heat and humidity were maintained with the
greatest care for twenty-four hours. No one in the house went to
sleep. The members of the Parisian Committee encamped in the
laboratory. Leon kept up the fire; M. Nibor,
M.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg
85]</a></span> Renault and M. Martout took turns in watching the
thermometer. Madame Renault was making tea and coffee, and punch too.
Gothon, who had taken communion in the morning, kept praying to God,
in the corner of her kitchen, that this impious miracle might not
succeed. A certain excitement already prevailed throughout the town,
but one did not know whether it should be attributed to
the <i>f&ecirc;te</i> of the 15th, or the famous undertaking of the
seven wise men of Paris.</p>

<p>By two o'clock on the 16th, encouraging results were obtained. The
skin and muscles had recovered nearly all their suppleness, but the
joints were still hard to bend. The collapsed condition of the walls
of the abdomen and the interval between the ribs, still indicated that
the viscera were far from having reabsorbed the quantity of water
which they had previously lost with Herr Meiser. A bath was prepared
and kept at a temperature of thirty-seven degrees and a
half.<a name="FNanchor_3_3"
id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[3]</sup></a> They left the Colonel in it two
hours and a half, taking care to frequently pass over his head a fine
sponge soaked with water.</p>

<p>M. Nibor removed him from the bath as soon as the skin, which was
filled out sooner than the other tissues, began to assume a whitish
tinge and wrinkle slightly. They kept him until the evening of the
16th in this humid room, where they arranged an apparatus which, from
time to time, occasioned a fine rain of a temperature of thirty-seven
and a half degrees. A new bath was given in the
evening.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg
86]</a></span> During the night, the body was enveloped in flannel,
but kept constantly in the same steaming atmosphere.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 17th, after a third bath of an hour and a
half, the general characteristics of the figure and the proportions of
the body presented their natural aspect: one would have called it a
sleeping man. Five or six curious persons were admitted to see it,
among others the colonel of the 23d. In the presence of these
witnesses, M. Nibor moved successively all the joints, and
demonstrated that they had recovered their flexibility. He gently
kneaded the limbs, trunk and abdomen. He partly opened the lips, and
separated the jaws, which were quite firmly closed, and saw that the
tongue had returned to its ordinary size and consistency. He also
partly opened the eyelids: the eye-balls were firm and bright.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the philosopher, "these are indications which do
not deceive; I prophesy success. In a few hours you shall witness the
first manifestations of life."</p>

<p>"But," interrupted one of the bystanders, "why not
immediately?"</p>

<p>"Because the <i>conjunctiv&aelig;</i> are still a little paler than
they ought to be. But the little veins traversing the whites of the
eyes have already assumed a very encouraging appearance. The blood is
almost entirely restored. What is the blood? Red globules floating in
serum, or a sort of whey. The serum
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg
87]</a></span> poor Fougas was dried up in his veins; the water which
we have gradually introduced by a slow endosmose has saturated the
albumen and fibrin of the serum, which is returned to the liquid
state. The red globules which desiccation had agglutinated, had become
motionless like ships stranded in shoal water. Now behold them afloat
again: they thicken, swell, round out their edges, detach themselves
from each other and prepare to circulate in their proper channels at
the first impulse which shall be given them by the contractions of the
heart."</p>

<p>"It remains to see," said M. Renault, "whether the heart will put
itself in motion. In a living man, the heart moves under the impulse
of the brain, transmitted by the nerves. The brain acts under the
impulse of the heart, transmitted by the arteries. The whole forms a
perfectly exact circle, without which there is no well-being. And when
neither heart nor brain acts, as in the Colonel's case, I don't see
which of the two can set the other in motion. You remember the scene
in the '<i>Ecole des femmes</i>,' where Arnolphe knocks at his door?
The valet and the maid, Alain and Georgette, are both in the house.
'Georgette!' cries Alain.&mdash;'Well?' replies Georgette.&mdash;'Open
the door down there!'&mdash;'Go yourself! Go
yourself!'&mdash;'Gracious me! I shan't go!'&mdash;'I shan't go
either!'&mdash;'Open it right away!'&mdash;'Open it yourself!' And
nobody opens it. I am inclined to think, Monsieur, that we are
attending a performance of this comedy. The house is the
body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg
88]</a></span> of the Colonel; Arnolphe, who wants to get in, is the
Vital Principle. The heart and brain act the parts of Alain and
Georgette. 'Open the door!' says one.&mdash;'Open it yourself!' says
the other. And the Vital Principle waits outside."</p>

<p>"Monsieur," replied Doctor Nibor smiling, "you forget the ending of
the scene. Arnolphe gets angry, and cries out: 'Whichever of you two
doesn't open the door, shan't have anything to eat for four days!' And
forthwith Alain hurries himself, Georgette runs and the door is
opened. Now bear in mind that I speak in this way only in order to
conform to your own course of reasoning, for the term 'Vital
Principle' is at variance with the actual assertions of science. Life
will manifest itself as soon as the brain, or the heart, or any one of
the organs which have the capacity of working spontaneously, shall
have absorbed the quantity of water it needs. Organized matter has
inherent properties which manifest themselves without the assistance
of any foreign principle, whenever they are surrounded by certain
conditions. Why do not M. Fougas' muscles contract yet? Why does not
the tissue of the brain enter into action? Because they have not yet
the amount of moisture necessary to them. In the fountain of life
there is lacking, perhaps, a pint of water. But I shall be in no hurry
to refill it: I am too much afraid of breaking it. Before giving this
gallant fellow a final bath, it will be necessary to knead all his
organs again, to subject his abdomen to regular
compressions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg
89]</a></span> in order that the serous membranes of the stomach,
chest and heart may be perfectly disagglutinated and capable of
slipping on each other. You are aware that the slightest tear in these
parts, or the least resistance, would be enough to kill our subject at
the moment of his revival."</p>

<p>While speaking, he united example to precept and kept kneading the
trunk of the Colonel. As the spectators had too nearly filled the
bath-room, making it almost impossible to move, M. Nibor begged them
to move into the laboratory. But the laboratory became so full that it
was necessary to leave it for the parlor: the Committee of the
Biological Society, had scarcely a corner of the table on which to
draw up their account of the proceedings. The parlor even was crowded
with people, the dining room too, and so out to the court yard of the
house. Friends, strangers, people not at all known to the family,
elbowed each other and waited in silence. But the silence of a crowd
is not much less noisy than the rolling of the sea. Fat Doctor
Martout, apparently overwhelmed with responsibility, showed himself
from time to time, and surged through the waves of curious people like
a galleon laden with news. Every one of his words circulated from
mouth to mouth, and spread even through the street, where several
groups of soldiers and citizens were making a stir, in more senses
than one. Never had the little "Rue de la Faisanderie" seen such a
crowd. An astonished passer-by stopped and
inquired:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg
90]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the matter here? Is it a funeral?"</p>

<p>"Quite the reverse, Sir."</p>

<p>"A christening, then?"</p>

<p>"With warm water!"</p>

<p>"A birth?"</p>

<p>"A being born again!"</p>

<p>An old judge of the Civil Court was recounting to a deputy the
legend of &AElig;son of old, who was boiled in Medea's caldron.</p>

<p>"This is almost the same experiment," said he, "and I am inclined
to think that the poets have calumniated the sorceress of Colchis.
There could be some fine Latin verses made appropriate to this
occasion; but I no longer possess my old skill!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Fabula Medeam cur crimine carpit iniquo?<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ecce novus surgit redivivus &AElig;son ab undis<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fortior, arma petens, juvenili pectore miles ...,<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Redivivus is taken in the active sense; it's a license, or at
least a bold construction. Ah! Monsieur! there was a time when I was,
even among those who made the most confident attempts, <i>the</i> man
for Latin verses!"</p>

<p>"Corp'ral!" said a conscript of the levy of 1859.</p>

<p>"What is it, Freminot?"</p>

<p>"Is it true that they are boiling an old soldier in a pot, and that
they are going to get him up again, Colonel's uniform and all?"</p>

<p>"True or not, subaltern, I'll run the risk of saying it's
true."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg
91]</a></span></p>

<p>"I fancy, with all proper deference, that they will not make much
at it."</p>

<p>"You should know, Freminot, that nothing is impossible to your
superiors! You are not unaware even now, that dried vegetables, on
being boiled, recover their original and natural appearance!"</p>

<p>"But, Corp'ral, if one were to cook them, three days' time, they'd
dissolve into broth."</p>

<p>"But, imbecile, why shouldn't one consider old soldiers hard to
cook?"</p>

<p>At noon, the commisioner of police and the lieutenant
of <i>gens-d'armes</i> made way through the crowd and entered the
house. These gentlemen hastened to declare to M. Renault that their
visit had nothing of an official character, but that they had come
merely from curiosity. In the corridor, they met the Sub-prefect, the
Mayor and Gothon, who was lamenting in loud tones that she should see
the government lend its hand to such sorceries.</p>

<p>About one o'clock, M. Nibor caused a new and prolonged bath to be
given the Colonel, on coming out of which, the body was subjected to a
kneading harder and more complete than before.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Doctor, "we can carry M. Fougas into the
laboratory, in order to give his resuscitation all the publicity
desirable. But it will be well to dress him, and his uniform is in
tatters."</p>

<p>"I think," answered good M. Renault, "that the Colonel is about my
size; so I can lend him some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92"
id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> my clothes. Heaven grant that he may
use them! But, between us, I don't hope for it."</p>

<p>Gothon brought in, grumbling, all that was necessary to dress an
entirely naked man. But her bad humor did not hold out before the
beauty of the Colonel:</p>

<p>"Poor gentleman!" she exclaimed, "he is young, fresh and fair as a
little chicken. If he doesn't revive, it will be a great pity!"</p>

<p>There were about forty people in the laboratory when Fougas was
carried thither. M. Nibor, assisted by M. Martout, placed him on a
sofa, and begged a few moments of attentive silence. During these
proceedings, Mme. Renault sent to inquire if she could come in. She
was admitted.</p>

<p>"Madame and gentlemen," said Dr. Nibor, "life will manifest itself
in a few minutes. It is possible that the muscles will act first, and
that their action may be convulsive, on account of not yet being
regulated by the influence of the nervous system. I ought to apprise
you of this fact, in order that you may not be frightened if such a
thing transpires. Madame, being a mother, ought to be less astonished
at it than any one else; she has experienced, at the fourth month of
pregnancy, the effect of those irregular movements which will,
possibly, soon be presented to us on a larger scale. I am quite
hopeful, however, that the first spontaneous contractions will take
place in the fibres of the heart. Such is the case in the embryo,
where the rhythmic movements of the heart, precede the nervous
functions."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg
93]</a></span></p>

<p>He again began making systematic compressions of the lower part of
the chest, rubbing the skin with his hands, half opening the eyelids,
examining the pulse, and auscultating the region of the heart.</p>

<p>The attention of the spectators was diverted an instant by a hubbub
outside. A battalion of the 23d was passing, with music at the head,
through the Rue de la Faisanderie. While the Sax-horns were shaking
the windows, a sudden flash mantled on the cheeks of the Colonel. His
eyes, which had stood half open, lit up with a brighter sparkle. At
the same instant, Doctor Nibor, who had his ear applied to the chest,
cried:</p>

<p>"I hear the beatings of the heart!"</p>

<p>Scarcely had he spoken, when the chest rose with a violent
inspiration, the limbs contracted, the body straightened up, and out
came a cry: "<i>Vive l'Empereur</i>."</p>

<p>But as if so great an effort had overtasked his strength, Colonel
Fougas fell back on the sofa, murmuring in a subdued voice:</p>

<p>"Where am I? Waiter! Bring me a
newspaper!"</p>

<h3>WHEREIN COLONEL FOUGAS LEARNS SOME NEWS WHICH WILL APPEAR OLD TO MY
READERS.</h3>


<p>Among all the persons present at this scene, there was not a single
one who had ever seen a resuscitation. I leave you to imagine the
surprise and joy which reigned in the laboratory. A triple round of
applause, mingled with cheers, hailed the triumph of Doctor Nibor. The
crowd, packed in the parlor, the passages, the court-yard, and even in
the street, understood at this signal, that the miracle was
accomplished. Nothing could hold them back, they forced the doors,
cleared all obstacles, upset all the philosophers who tried to stop
them, and finished by pouring into the chamber of Science.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen!" cried M. Nibor, "Do you want to kill him?"</p>

<p>But they let him talk. The wildest of all passions, curiosity, had
long held dominion over the crowd: every one wanted to see, though at
the risk of crushing the others. M. Nibor tumbled down, M. Renault and
his son, in attempting to help him, were thrown on top of him; Madame
Renault, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg
95]</a></span> her turn, was thrown down at the feet of Fougas, and
began screaming at the top of her voice.</p>

<p>"Damnation!" said Fougas, straightening himself up as if by a
spring, "these scoundrels will suffocate us if some one doesn't
squelch them!" His attitude, the glare of his eyes, and, above all,
the prestige of the miraculous, cleared a space around him. One would
have thought that the walls had been stretched or that the spectators
had slid into one another!</p>

<p>"Out of here, every mother's son of you!" cried Fougas, in his
fiercest tone of command. A tumult of cries, explanations, and
remonstrances was raised around him; he fancied he heard menaces, he
seized the first chair within reach, brandished it like a weapon,
drove, hammered, upset the citizens, soldiers,
officials, <i>savants</i>, friends, sight-seers, commissary of
police&mdash;everybody, and urged the human torrent into the street
with an uproar perfectly indescribable. This done, he shut the door
and bolted it, returned to the laboratory, saw three men standing near
Madame Renault, and said to the old lady, softening the tone of his
voice:</p>

<p>"Well, good mother, shall I serve these three like the others?"</p>

<p>"No! No! No! Be careful!" cried the good old lady. "My husband and
my son, Monsieur, and Doctor Nibor, who has restored you to life."</p>

<p>"In that case all honor to them, good mother! Fougas has never
violated the laws of gratitude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96"
id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> and hospitality. As for you, my
Esculapius, give me your hand!"</p>

<p>At the same instant, he noticed ten or a dozen inquisitive people
on tiptoe on the pavement just by the windows of the laboratory.
Forthwith he marched and opened them with a precipitation which upset
the gazers among the crowd.</p>

<p>"People," said he, "I have knocked down a hundred beggarly pandours
who respect neither sex nor infirmity. For the benefit of those who
are not satisfied, I will state that I call myself colonel Fougas of
the 23d. And <i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>"</p>

<p>A confused mixture of plaudits, cries, laughs, and jeers, answered
this unprecedented allocution. Leon Renault hastened out to make
apologies to all to whom they were due. He invited a few friends to
dine the same evening with the terrible colonel, and, of course, he
did not forget to send a special messenger to Clementine. Fougas,
after speaking to the people, returned to his hosts, swinging himself
along with a swaggering air, set himself astride a chair, took hold of
the ends of his moustache, and said:</p>

<p>"Well! Come, let's talk this over. I've been sick then?"</p>

<p>"Very sick."</p>

<p>"That's fabulous! I feel entirely well. I'm hungry, and, moreover,
while waiting for dinner, I'll even try a glass of your schnick."</p>

<p>Mme. Renault went out, gave an order, and returned in an
instant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg
97]</a></span></p>

<p>"But tell me, then, where I am," resumed the colonel. "By these
paraphernalia of work, I recognize a disciple of Urania; possibly a
friend of Monge and Berthollet. But the cordial friendliness impressed
on your countenances proves to me that you are not natives of this
land of sour-krout. Yes, I believe it from the beatings of my heart.
Friends, we have the same fatherland. The kindness of your reception,
even were there no other indications, would have satisfied me that you
are French. What accidents have brought you so far from our native
soil? Children of my country, what tempest has thrown you upon this
inhospitable shore?"</p>

<p>"My dear Colonel," replied M. Nibor, "if you want to become very
wise, you will not ask so many questions at once. Allow us the
pleasure of instructing you quietly and in order, for you have a great
many things to learn."</p>

<p>The Colonel flushed with anger, and answered sharply:</p>

<p>"At all events, you are not the man to teach them to me, my little
gentleman!"</p>

<p>A drop of blood which fell on his hand changed the current of his
thoughts:</p>

<p>"Hold on!" said he; "am I bleeding?"</p>

<p>"That will amount to nothing; circulation is re&euml;stablished,
and your broken ear...."</p>

<p>He quickly carried his hand to his ear and said:</p>

<p>"It's certainly so. But Devil take me if I recollect this
accident!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg
98]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll make you a little dressing, and in a couple of days there
will be no trace of it left!"</p>

<p>"Don't give yourself the trouble, my dear Hippocrates; a pinch of
powder is a sovereign cure!"</p>

<p>M. Nibor set to work to dress the ear in a little less military
fashion. During his operations, Leon re&euml;ntered.</p>

<p>"Ah! ah!" said he to the Doctor, "you are repairing the harm I
did."</p>

<p>"Thunderation!" cried Fougas, escaping from the hands of M. Nibor
so as to seize Leon by the collar, "was it you, you rascal, that hurt
my ear?"</p>

<p>Leon was very good-natured, but his patience failed him. He pushed
his man roughly aside.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it was I who tore your ear, in pulling it, and if that
little misfortune had not happened to me, it is certain that you would
have been, to-day, six feet under ground. It is I who saved your life,
after buying you with my money when you were not valued at more than
twenty-five louis. It is I who have passed three days and two nights
in cramming charcoal under your boiler. It is my father who gave you
the clothes you now have on. You are in our house. Drink the little
glass of brandy Gothon just brought you; but for God's sake give up
the habit of calling me rascal, of calling my mother 'Good Mother.'
and of flinging our friends into the street and calling them beggarly
pandours!"</p>

<p>The colonel, all dumbfounded, held out his hand to Leon, M. Renault
and the doctor, gallantly
kissed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg
99]</a></span> the hand of Mme. Renault, swallowed at a gulp a claret
glass filled to the brim with brandy, and said in a subdued voice:</p>

<p>"Most excellent friends, forget the vagaries of an impulsive but
generous soul. To subdue my passions shall hereafter be my law. After
conquering all the nations in the universe, it is well to conquer
one's self."</p>

<p>This said, he submitted his ear to M. Nibor, who finished dressing
it.</p>

<p>"But," said he, summoning up his recollections, "they did not shoot
me then?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And I wasn't frozen to death in the tower?"</p>

<p>"Not quite."</p>

<p>"Why has my uniform been taken off? I see! I am a prisoner!"</p>

<p>"You are free."</p>

<p>"Free! <i>Vive l'Empereur!</i> But then, there's not a moment to
lose! How many leagues is it to Dantzic?"</p>

<p>"It's very far."</p>

<p>"What do you call this chicken coop of a town?"</p>

<p>"Fontainebleau."</p>

<p>"Fontainebleau! In France?"</p>

<p>"Prefecture of Seine-et-Marne. We are going to introduce to you the
sub-prefect, whom you just pitched into the street."</p>

<p>"What the Devil are your sub-prefects to
me?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg
100]</a></span> I have a message from the Emperor for General Rapp,
and I must start, this very day, for Dantzic. God knows whether I'll
be there in time!"</p>

<p>"My poor Colonel, you will arrive too late. Dantzic is given
up."</p>

<p>"That's impossible! Since when?"</p>

<p>"About forty-six years ago."</p>

<p>"Thunder! I did not understand that you were ... mocking me!"</p>

<p>M. Nibor placed in his hand a calendar, and said: "See for
yourself! It is now the 17th of August, 1859; you went to sleep in the
tower of Liebenfeld on the 11th of November, 1813; there have been,
then, forty-six years, all to three months, during which the world has
moved on without you."</p>

<p>"Twenty-four and forty-six; but then I would be seventy years old,
according to your statement!"</p>

<p>"Your vitality clearly shows that you are still twenty-four."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, tore up the calendar and said, beating
the floor with his foot: "Your almanac is a humbug!"</p>

<p>M. Renault ran to his library, took up half a dozen books at
haphazard and made him read, at the foot of the title pages, the dates
1826, 1833, 1847, 1858.</p>

<p>"Pardon me!" said Fougas, burying his head in his hands. "What has
happened to me is so new! I do not think that another human being was
ever subjected to such a trial. I am seventy years
old!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg
101]</a></span></p>

<p>Good Madame Renault went and got a looking-glass from the bath
room, and gave it to him, saying:</p>

<p>"Look!"</p>

<p>He took the glass in both hands, and was silently occupied in
resuming acquaintance with himself, when a hand-organ came into the
court and began playing "Partant pour la Syrie!"</p>

<p>Fougas threw the mirror to the ground, and cried out:</p>

<p>"What is that you were telling me? I hear the little song of Queen
Hortense!"<a name="FNanchor_4_4"
id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p>M. Renault patiently explained to him, while picking up the pieces
of the mirror, that the pretty little song of Queen Hortense had
become a national air, and even an official one, since the regimental
bands had substituted that gentle melody for the fierce Marsellaise,
and that our soldiers, strange to say, had not fought any the worse
for it. But the Colonel had already opened the window, and was crying
out to the Savoyard:</p>

<p>"Eh! Friend! A napoleon for you if you will tell me in what year I
am drawing the breath of life!"</p>

<p>The artist began dancing as lightly as possible playing on his
musical instrument.</p>

<p>"Advance at the order!" cried the Colonel, "and keep that devilish
machine still!"</p>

<p>"A little penny, my good monsieur!"</p>

<p>"It is not a penny that I'll give you, but a napoleon, if you'll
tell me what year it is."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102"
id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh but that's funny! Hi&mdash;hi&mdash;hi!"</p>

<p>"And if you don't tell me quicker than this amounts to, I'll cut
your ears off!"</p>

<p>The Savoyard ran away, but he came back pretty soon, having
meditated, during his flight, on the maxim: "Nothing risk nothing
gain."</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said he, in a wheedling voice, "this is the year
Eighteen Hundred and Fifty-nine."</p>

<p>"Good!" cried Fougas. He felt in his pockets for money, and found
nothing there. Leon saw his predicament, and flung twenty francs into
the court. Before shutting the window, he pointed out, to the right,
the fa&ccedil;ade of a pretty little new building where the Colonel
could distinctly read</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">AUDRET ARCHITECTE.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">MDCCCLIX.</span> </p></blockquote>

<p>A perfectly satisfactory piece of evidence, and one which did not
cost twenty francs.</p>

<p>Fougas, a little confused, pressed Leon's hand, and said to
him:</p>

<p>"My friend, I do not forget that Confidence is the first duty from
Gratitude toward Beneficence. But tell me of our country! I tread the
sacred soil where I received my being, and I am ignorant of the career
of my native land. France is still the queen of the world, is she
not?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Leon.</p>

<p>"How is the Emperor?"</p>

<p>"Well."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg
103]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the Empress?"</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"And the King of Rome?"</p>

<p>"The Prince Imperial? He is a very fine child."</p>

<p>"How? A fine child! And you have the face to say that this is
1859!"</p>

<p>M. Nibor took up the conversation, and explained in a few words
that the reigning sovereign of France was not Napoleon I., but
Napoleon III.</p>

<p>"But then," cried Fougas, "my Emperor is dead!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Impossible! Tell me anything you will but that! My Emperor is
immortal."</p>

<p>M. Nibor and the Renaults, who were not quite professional
historians, were obliged to give him a summary of the history of our
century. Some one went after a big book written by M. de Norvins and
illustrated with fine engravings by Raffet. He only believed in the
presence of Truth when he could touch her with his hand, and still
cried out almost every moment: "That's impossible! This is not history
that you are reading to me: it is a romance written to make soldiers
weep!"</p>

<p>This young man must indeed have had a strong and well-tempered
soul, for he learned in forty minutes all the woful events which
Fortune had scattered through eighteen years, from the first
abdication up to the death of the King of Rome. Less happy than his
old companions in arms, he had no
interval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg
104]</a></span> of repose between these terrible and repeated shocks,
all beating upon his heart at the same time. One could have feared
that the blow might prove mortal, and poor Fougas die in the first
hour of his recovered life. But the imp of a fellow yielded and
recovered himself in quick succession like a spring. He cried out with
admiration on hearing of the five battles of the campaign in France;
he reddened with grief at the farewells of Fontainebleau. The return
from the Isle of Elba transfigured his handsome and noble countenance;
at Waterloo his heart rushed in with the last army of the Empire, and
there shattered itself. Then he clenched his fists and said between
his teeth: "If I had been there at the head of the 23d, Blucher and
Wellington would have seen another fate!" The invasion, the truce, the
martyr of St. Helena, the ghastly terror of Europe, the murder of
Murat&mdash;the idol of the cavalry, the death of Ney, Bruno, Mouton
Duvernet, and so many other whole-souled men whom he had known,
admired, and loved, threw him into a series of paroxysms of rage, but
nothing upset him. In hearing of the death of Napoleon, he swore that
he would eat the heart of England; the slow agony of the pale and
interesting heir of the Empire, inspired him with a passion to tear
the vitals out of Austria. When the drama was over and the curtain
fell on Schoenbrunn, he dashed away his tears and said: "It is well. I
have lived in a moment a man's entire life. Now show me the map of
France!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg
105]</a></span></p>

<p>Leon began to turn over the leaves of an atlas, while M. Renault
attempted to continue narrating to the colonel the history of the
Restoration, and of the monarchy of 1830. But Fougas' interest was in
other things.</p>

<p>"What do I care," said he, "if a couple of hundred babblers of
deputies put one king in place of another? Kings! I've seen enough of
them in the dirt. If the Empire had lasted ten years longer, I could
have had a king for a boot-black."</p>

<p>When the atlas was placed before him, he at once cried out with
profound disdain: "That, France!" But soon two tears of pitying
affection escaping from his eyes, swelled the rivers Ardeche and
Gironde. He kissed the map and said, with an emotion which
communicated itself to nearly all present:</p>

<p>"Forgive me, poor old love, for insulting your misfortunes. Those
scoundrels whom we always whipped have profited by my sleep to pare
down your frontiers; but little or great, rich or poor, you are my
mother, and I love you as a faithful son! Here is Corsica, where the
giant of our age was born; here is Toulouse, where I first saw the
light; here is Nancy where I felt my heart awakened, where, perhaps,
she whom I call my &AElig;gle waits for me still! France! Thou hast a
temple in my soul; this arm is thine; thou shalt find me ever ready to
shed my blood to the last drop in defending or avenging
thee!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>THE CONVALESCENT'S FIRST MEAL.</h3>


<p>The messenger whom Leon had sent to Moret, could not reach there
before seven o'clock. Supposing that he would find the ladies at table
with their hosts, that the great news would cut the dinner short, and
that there would be a carriage handy, Clementine and her aunt would
probably be at Fontainebleau between ten and eleven o'clock. Young
Renault rejoiced in advance over the happiness of
his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>. What a joy it would be for her and for him
when he should present to her the miraculous man whom she had
protected against the horrors of the tomb, and whom he had
resuscitated in answer to her entreaty!</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gothon, proud and happy to the same degree that she had
before been scandalized and annoyed, spread the table for a dozen
persons. Her yoke-fellow, a young rustic of eighteen, half-fledged in
the commune of Sablons, helped her with all his might, and amused her
with his conversation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107"
id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, now, Ma'm'selle Gothon," said he, setting down a pile of
empty plates, "this is what one might call a ghost coming out of its
box to upset the commissary and the sub-prefect!"</p>

<p>"Ghost, if you'll have it so, C&eacute;lestin; it's certain-sure
that he comes from a good ways, poor young man! But perhaps 'ghost'
isn't a proper word to use in speaking of our masters."</p>

<p>"Is it true, then, that he has come to be our master too? Too many
of
<i>them</i> come every day. I'd like it better if more servants and help
would come!"</p>

<p>"Shut up, you lizard of laziness! When the gentlemen leaves tips
for us on going away, you don't complain because there's only two to
divide 'em."</p>

<p>"That's all well enough as far as it goes! I've carried more than
fifty buckets of water for him to simmer in, that Colonel of yours,
and I know mighty well that he won't give me a cent, for he hasn't a
farthing in his pockets. We've got to believe that money isn't plenty
in the country he just came from!"</p>

<p>"They say there's wills in his favor in Strasburg; a gentleman
who'd hurt his fortune&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me now, Ma'm'selle Gothon&mdash;you who read a little book
every Sunday&mdash;where he could have been, our Colonel, while he was
not in this world."</p>

<p>"Eh! In purgatory, of course!"</p>

<p>"Then why don't you ask him about that famous Baptiste, your
sweetheart in 1837, who let
himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg
108]</a></span> tumble off a roof, and on whose account you have so
many masses said? They ought to have met each other down there!"</p>

<p>"That's very possible."</p>

<p>"Unless Baptiste has left there since the time when you paid so
much money to get him out."</p>

<p>"Very well. I'll go this very evening to the Colonel's chamber,
and, since he's not proud, he'll tell me all he knows about
it.&mdash;But, C&eacute;lestin, are'nt you never going to act
different? Here you've rubbed my silver pickle knives on the
grindstone again!"</p>

<p>The guests came into the parlor, where the Renault family with M.
Nibor and the Colonel were already assembled. There were successively
presented to M. Fougas the mayor of the city, Doctor Martout, Master
Bonnivet the notary, M. Audret, and three members of the Paris
committee; the other three had been obliged to return before dinner.
The guests were not entirely at their ease; their sides, bruised by
the first movements of Fougas, left room for them to suppose that
possibly they were dining with a maniac. But curiosity was stronger
than fear. The Colonel soon reassured them by a most cordial
reception. He excused himself for acting the part of a man just
returned from the other world. He talked a great deal&mdash;a little
too much, perhaps; but they were so well pleased to listen to him, and
his words borrowed such an importance from the singularity of recent
events, that he gained an unqualified success. He was told that Dr.
Martout had been one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109"
id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> of the principal agents of his
resuscitation, in conjunction with another person whom they promised
soon to present to him. He thanked M. Martout warmly, and asked how
soon he could evince his gratitude to the other person.</p>

<p>"I hope," said Leon, "that you will see her this evening."</p>

<p>No one came later than the colonel of the 23d of the line, M.
Rollon. He made his way with no little difficulty through the crowds
of people who filled the Rue de la Faisanderie. He was a man of
forty-five, with a quick voice, and full figure. His hair was a little
grizzled, but his brown mustache, full, and twisted at the ends,
looked as young as ever. He said little, spoke to the point, knew a
great deal, and did no boasting&mdash;all in all, he was a fine
specimen of a colonel. He came right up to Fougas, and held out his
hand like an old acquaintance.</p>

<p>"My dear comrade," said he, "I have taken great interest in your
resurrection, as much on my own account as on account of the regiment.
The 23d which I have the honor to command, yesterday venerated you as
an ancestor. From to-day, it will cherish you as a friend."&mdash;Not
the slightest allusion to the affair of the morning, in which M.
Rollon had undergone his pummelling with the rest.</p>

<p>Fougas answered becomingly, but with, a tinge of coldness:</p>

<p>"My dear comrade, I thank you for your kindly sentiments. It is
singular that Destiny places me
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg
110]</a></span> the presence of my successor on the very day that I
reopen my eyes to the light; for, after all, I am neither dead nor a
general; I have not been transferred, nor have I been retired; yet I
see another officer, more worthy, doubtless, at the head of my noble
23d. But if you have for your motto 'Honor and Courage,' as I am well
satisfied you have, I have no right to complain, and the regiment is
in good hands."</p>

<p>Dinner was ready. Mme. Renault took Fougas' arm. She had him sit at
her right, and M. Nibor at her left. The Colonel and the Mayor took
their places at the sides of M. Renault; the rest of the company
distributed themselves as it happened, regardless of etiquette.</p>

<p>Fougas gulped down the soup and <i>entr&eacute;es</i>, helping
himself to every dish, and drinking in proportion. An appetite of the
other world! "Estimable Amphitryon," said he to M. Renault, "don't get
frightened at seeing me fall upon the rations. I always ate just so;
except during the retreat in Russia. Consider, too, that I went to
sleep last night, at Liebenfeld, without any supper."</p>

<p>He begged M. Nibor to explain to him by what course of
circumstances he had come from Liebenfeld to Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," said the doctor, "an old German who acted as
interpreter for you before the court-martial?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. An excellent man, with a
violet-col<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg
111]</a></span>ored wig. I'll remember him all my life, for there are
not two wigs of that color in existence."</p>

<p>"Very well; it was the man with the violet wig, otherwise known as
the celebrated Doctor Meiser, who saved your life."</p>

<p>"Where is he? I want to see him, to fall into his arms, to tell
him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was sixty-eight years old when he did you that little service;
he would then be, to-day, in his hundred and fifteenth year, if he had
waited for your acknowledgments."</p>

<p>"And so, then, he is no more! Death has robbed him of my
gratitude!"</p>

<p>"You do not yet know all that you owe to him. He bequeathed you, in
1824, a fortune of seventy-five thousand francs, of which you are the
rightful owner. Now, since a sum invested at five per cent, doubles
itself in fourteen years&mdash;thanks to compound interest&mdash;you
were worth, in 1838, a trifle of seven hundred and fifty thousand
francs; and in 1852, a million and a half. In fine, if you are
satisfied to leave your property in the hands of Herr Nicholas Meiser,
of Dantzic, that worthy man will owe you three millions at the
commencement of 1866&mdash;that is to say, in seven years. We will
give you, this evening, a copy of your benefactor's will; it is a very
instructive document, and you can consider it when you go to bed."</p>

<p>"I'll read it willingly," said Colonel Fougas. "But gold has no
attractions for my eyes. Wealth engenders weakness. Me, to languish in
the sluggish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg
112]</a></span> idleness of Sybaris!&mdash;to enervate my senses on a
bed of roses! Never! The smell of powder is dearer to me than all the
perfumes of Arabia. Life would have no charm or zest for me, if I had
to give up the inspiriting clash of arms. On the day when you are told
that Fougas no longer marches in the columns of the army, you can
safely answer, 'It is because Fougas is no more!'"</p>

<p>He turned to the new colonel of the 23d, and said:</p>

<p>"Oh! do you, my dear comrade, tell them that the proud pomp of
wealth is a thousand times less sweet than the austere simplicity of
the soldier&mdash;of a colonel, more than all. Colonels are the kings
of the army. A colonel is less than a general, but nevertheless he has
something more. He lives more with the soldier; he penetrates further
into the intimacy of his command. He is the father, the judge, the
friend of his regiment. The welfare of each one of his men is in his
hands; the flag is placed under his tent or in his chamber. The
colonel and the flag are not two separate existences; one is the soul,
the other is the body."</p>

<p>He asked M. Rollon's permission to go to see and embrace the flag
of the 23d.</p>

<p>"You shall see it to-morrow morning," said the new colonel, "if you
will do me the honor to breakfast with me in company with some of my
officers."</p>

<p>He accepted the invitation with enthusiasm, and flung himself into
the midst of a thousand
questions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg
113]</a></span> touching pay, the amount retained for clothing,
promotion, roster, reserve, uniform, full and fatigue dress, armament,
and tactics. He understood, without difficulty, the advantages of the
percussion gun, but the attempt to explain rifled cannon to him was in
vain. Artillery was not his forte; but he avowed, nevertheless, that
Napoleon had owed more than one victory to his fine artillery.</p>

<p>While the innumerable roasts of Mme. Renault were succeeding each
other on the table, Fougas asked&mdash;but without ever losing a
bite&mdash;what were the principal wars in progress, how many nations
France had on her hands, and if it was not intended ultimately to
recommence the conquest of the world? The answers which he received,
without completely satisfying him, did not entirely deprive him of
hope.</p>

<p>"I did well to come," said he; "there's work to do."</p>

<p>The African wars did not interest him much, although in them the
23d had won a good share of glory.</p>

<p>"As a school, it's very well," said he. "The soldier ought to train
himself in other ways than in the Tivoli gardens, behind nurses'
petticoats. But why the devil are not five hundred thousand men flung
upon the back of England? England is the soul of the coalition, I can
tell you that."</p>

<p>How many explanations were necessary to make him understand the
Crimean war, where the English had fought by our
sides!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg
114]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can understand," said he, "why we took a crack at the
Russians&mdash;they made me eat my best horse. But the English are a
thousand times worse. If this young man" (the Emperor Napoleon III.)
"doesn't know it, I'll tell him. There is no quarter possible after
what they did at St. Helena! If I had been commander-in-chief in the
Crimea, I would have begun by properly squelching the Russians, after
which I would have turned upon the English, and hurled them into the
sea. It's their element, anyhow."</p>

<p>They gave him some details of the Italian campaign, and he was
charmed to learn that the 23d had taken a redoubt under the eyes of
the Marshal the Duke of Solferino.</p>

<p>"That's the habit of the regiment," said he, shedding tears in his
napkin. "That brigand of a 23d will never act in any other way. The
goddess of Victory has touched it with her wing."</p>

<p>One of the things, for example, which greatly astonished him, was
that a war of such importance was finished up in so short a time. He
had yet to learn that within a few years the world had learned the
secret of transporting a hundred thousand men, in four days, from one
end of Europe to the other.</p>

<p>"Good!" said he; "I admit the practicability of it. But what
astonishes me is, that the Emperor did not invent this affair in 1810;
for he had a genius for transportation, a genius for administration, a
genius for office details, a genius for
everything.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg
115]</a></span> But (to resume your story) the Austrians are fortified
at last, and you cannot possibly get to Vienna in less than three
months."</p>

<p>"We did not go so far, in fact."</p>

<p>"You did not push on to Vienna?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, then, where did you sign the treaty of peace?"</p>

<p>"At Villafranca."</p>

<p>"At Villafranca? That's the capital of Austria, then?"</p>

<p>"No; it's a village of Italy."</p>

<p>"Monsieur, I don't admit that treaties of peace are signed anywhere
but in capitals. That was our principle, our A B C, the first
paragraph of our theory. It seems as if the world must have changed a
good deal while I was not in it. But patience!"</p>

<p>And now truth obliges me to confess that Fougas got drunk at
dessert. He had drunk and eaten like a Homeric hero, and talked more
fluently than Cicero in his best days. The fumes of wine, spices, and
eloquence mounted into his brain. He became familiar, spoke
affectionately to some and rudely to others, and poured out a torrent
of absurdities big enough to turn forty mills. His drunkenness,
however, had in it nothing brutal, or even ignoble; it was but the
overflowing of a spirit young, affectionate, vain-glorious, and
unbalanced. He proposed five or six toasts&mdash;to Glory, to the
Extension of our Frontiers, to the Destruction of the last of the
English, to Mlle. Mars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116"
id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>&mdash;the hope of the French stage,
to Affection&mdash;the tie, fragile but dear, which unites the lover
to his sweetheart, the father to his son, the colonel to his
regiment!</p>

<p>His style, a singular mixture of familiarity and impressiveness,
provoked more than one smile among the auditory. He noticed it, and a
spark of defiance flashed up at the bottom of his heart. From time to
time he loudly asked if "those people there" were not abusing his
ingenuousness.</p>

<p>"Confusion!" cried he, "Confusion to those who want me to take
bladders for lanterns! The lantern may blaze out like a bomb, and
carry consternation in its path!"</p>

<p>After a series of such remarks, there was nothing left for him to
do but to roll under the table, and
this <i>d&eacute;no&ucirc;ement</i> was generally expected. But the
Colonel belonged to a robust generation, accustomed to more than one
kind of excess, and strong to resist pleasure as well as dangers,
privations, and fatigues. So when Madame Renault pushed back her
chair, in indication that the repast was finished, Fougas arose
without difficulty, gracefully offered his arm, and conducted his
partner to the parlor. His gait was a little stiff and oppressively
regular, but he went straight ahead, and did not oscillate the least
bit. He took a couple of cups of coffee, and spirits in moderation,
after which he began to talk in the most reasonable manner in the
world. About ten o'clock, M. Martout, having expressed a wish to hear
his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg
117]</a></span> history, he placed himself on a stool, collected his
ideas for a moment, and asked for a glass of water and sugar. The
company seated themselves in a circle around him, and he commenced the
following narrative, the slightly antiquated style of which craves
your indulgence.</p>

<h3>HISTORY OF COLONEL FOUGAS, RELATED BY HIMSELF.</h3>


<p>"Do not expect that I will ornament my story with those flowers,
more agreeable than substantial, which Imagination often uses to gloss
over truth. A Frenchman and a soldier, I doubly ignore deception.
Friendship interrogates me, Frankness shall answer.</p>

<p>"I was born of poor but honest parents at the beginning of the year
which the <i>Jeu de Paume</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5"
id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[5]</sup></a> brightened with an aurora of
liberty. The south was my native clime; the language dear to the
troubadours was that which I lisped in my cradle. My birth cost my
mother's life. The author of mine was the humble owner of a little
farm, and moistened his bread in the sweat of labor. My first sports
were not those of wealth. The many-colored pebbles which are found by
the brooks, and that well-known insect which childhood holds
fluttering, free and captive at the same time, at the end of a thread,
stood me in stead of other playthings.</p>

<p>"An old minister at Devotion's altar, enfranchised from the shadowy
bondage of fanaticism, and reconciled to the new institutions of
France, was my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119"
id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> Chiron and Mentor. He nourished me
with the strong lion's marrow of Rome and Athens; his lips distilled
into my ears the embalmed honey of wisdom. Honor to thee, learned and
venerable man, who gavest me the first precepts of wisdom and the
first examples of virtue!</p>

<p>"But already that atmosphere of glory which the genius of one man
and the valor of a nation had set floating over the country, filled
all my senses, and made my young heart throb. France, on the edge of
the volcano of civil war, had collected all her forces into a
thunderbolt to launch upon Europe, and the world, astounded if not
overwhelmed, was shrinking from the surge of the unchained torrent.
What man, what Frenchman, could have heard with indifference that echo
of victory reverberating through millions of hearts?</p>

<p>"While scarcely leaving childhood, I felt that honor is more
precious than life. The warlike music of the drums brought to my eyes
brave and manly tears. 'And I, too,' said I, following the music of
the regiments through the streets of Toulouse, 'will pluck laurels
though I sprinkle them with my blood.' The pale olive of peace had
from me nothing but scorn. The peaceful triumphs of the law, the calm
pleasures of commerce and finance, were extolled in vain. To the toga
of our Ciceros, to the robe of our magistrates, to the curule chair of
our legislators, to the opulence of our Mondors, I preferred the
sword. One would have said that I had sucked the milk
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg
120]</a></span> Bellona. 'Victory or Death!' was already my motto, and
I was not sixteen years old.</p>

<p>"With what noble scorn I heard recounted the history of our
Proteuses of politics! With what disdainful glances I regarded the
Turcarets of finance, lolling on the cushions of some magnificent
carriage, and conducted by a laced automaton to the boudoir of some
Aspasia. But if I heard told the mighty deeds of the Knights of the
Round Table, or the valor of the crusaders celebrated in flowing
verse; if chance placed in my hand the great actions of our modern
Rolands, recounted in an army bulletin by the successor of
Charlemagne, a flame presaging the fire of battles rose in my young
eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah, the inaction was too much, and my leading-strings, already
worn by impatience, would have broken, perhaps, had not a father's
wisdom untied them.</p>

<p>"'Most surely,' said he to me, trying, but in vain, to restrain his
tears, 'it was no tyrant who begot you, and I will not poison the life
which I myself gave you. I had hoped that your hand would remain in
our cottage to close my eyes; but when Patriotism has spoken, Egotism
must be still. My prayers will always follow you to the field where
Mars harvests heroes. May you merit the guerdon of valor, and show
yourself a good citizen, as you have been a good son!'</p>

<p>"Speaking thus, he opened his arms to me. I threw myself into them;
we mingled our tears, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121"
id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> I promised to return to our
hearthstone as soon as I could bring the star of honor suspended from
my breast. But alas! my unhappy father was destined to see me no more.
The fate which was already gilding the thread of my days, pitilessly
severed that of his. A stranger's hand closed his eyes, while I was
gaining my first epaulette at the battle of Jena.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant at Eylau, captain at Wagram, and there decorated by the
Emperor's own hand on the field of battle, major before Almieda,
lieutenant-colonel at Badajoz, colonel at Moscow, I have drunk the cup
of victory to the full. But I have also tasted the chalice of
adversity. The frozen plains of Russia saw me alone with a platoon of
braves, the last remnant of my regiment, forced to devour the mortal
remains of that faithful friend who had so often carried me into the
very heart of the enemy's battalions. Trusty and affectionate
companion of my dangers, when rendered useless by an accident at
Smolensk, he devoted his very
<i>manes</i> to the safety of his master, and made of his skin a protection
for my frozen and lacerated feet.</p>

<p>"My tongue refuses to repeat the story of our perils in that
terrible campaign. Perhaps some day I will write it with a pen dipped
in tears&mdash;tears, the tribute of feeble humanity. Surprised by the
season of frosts in a zone of ice, without fire, without bread,
without shoes, without means of transportation, denied the succor of
Esculapius' art, harassed by
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg
122]</a></span> Cossacks, robbed by the peasants&mdash;positive
vampires, we saw our mute thunderers, which had fallen into the
enemy's hands, belch forth death upon ourselves. What more can I tell
you? The passage of the Beresina, the opposition at Wilna&mdash;Oh, ye
gods of Thunder!&mdash;- But I feel that grief overcomes me, and that
my language is becoming tinged with the bitterness of these
recollections.</p>

<p>"Nature and Love were holding in reserve for me brief but precious
consolations. Released from my fatigues, I passed a few happy days in
my native land among the peaceful vales of Nancy. While our phalanxes
were preparing themselves for fresh combats, while I was gathering
around my flag three thousand young but valorous warriors, all
resolved to open to posterity the path of honor, a new emotion, to
which I had before been a stranger, furtively glided into my soul.</p>

<p>"Beautified by all Nature's gifts, enriched by the fruits of an
excellent education, the young and interesting Clementine had scarcely
passed from the uncertain shadows of childhood into the sweet
illusions of youth. Eighteen springs composed her life. Her parents
extended to some of the army officers a hospitality which, though it
was not gratuitous, was far from lacking in cordiality. To see their
child and love her, was for me the affair of a day. Her virgin heart
smiled upon my love. At the first avowals dictated to me by my
passion, I saw her forehead color with a lovely modesty. We exchanged
our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg
123]</a></span> vows one lovely evening in June, under an arbor where
her happy father sometimes dispensed to the thirsty officers the brown
liquor of the North. I swore that she should be my wife, and she
promised to be mine; she yielded still more. Our happiness, regardless
of all outside, had the calmness of a brook whose pure wave is never
troubled by the storm, and which rolls sweetly between flowery banks,
spreading its own freshness through the grove that protects its modest
course.</p>

<p>"A lightning stroke separated us from each other at the moment when
Law and Religion were about adding their sanction to our sweet
communion. I departed before I was able to give my name to her who had
given me her heart. I promised to return; she promised to wait for me;
and, all bathed in her tears, I tore myself from her arms, to rush to
the laurels of Dresden and the cypresses of Leipzic. A few lines from
her hand reached me during the interval between the two battles. 'You
are to be a father,' she told me. Am I one? God knows! Has she waited
for me? I believe she has. The waiting must have appeared to be a long
one since the birth of this child, who is forty-six years old to-day,
and who could be, in his turn, my father.</p>

<p>"Pardon me for having troubled you so long with misfortunes. I
wished to pass rapidly over this sad history, but the unhappiness of
virtue has in it something sweet to temper the bitterness of
grief.</p>

<p>"Some days after the disaster of Leipzic,
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg
124]</a></span> giant of our age had me called into his tent, and said
to me:</p>

<p>"'Colonel, are you a man to make your way through four armies?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sire.'</p>

<p>"'Alone, and without escort?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sire.'</p>

<p>"'There must be a letter carried to Dantzic.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sire.'</p>

<p>"'You will deliver it into General Rapp's own hands?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sire.'</p>

<p>"'It is probable you will be taken, or killed.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sire.'</p>

<p>"'For that reason I send two other officers with copies of the same
despatch. There are three of you; the enemy will kill two, the third
will get there, and France will be saved.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sire.'</p>

<p>"'The one who returns shall be a brigadier-general.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sire.'</p>

<p>"Every detail of this interview, every word of the Emperor, every
response which I had the honor to address to him, is still engraved
upon my memory. All three of us set out separately. Alas! not one of
us reached the goal aimed at by his valor, and I have learned to-day
that France was not saved. But when I see these blockheads of
historians asserting that the Emperor forgot to send orders to General
Rapp, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg
125]</a></span> feel a terrible itching to cut their &mdash;&mdash;
story short, at least.</p>

<p>"'When a prisoner in the hands of the Russians in a German village,
I had the consolation of finding an old philosopher, who gave me the
rarest proofs of friendship. Who would have told me, when I succumbed
to the numbness of the cold in the tower of Liebenfeld, that that
sleep would not be the last? God is my witness, that in then
addressing, from the bottom of my heart, a last farewell to
Clementine, I did not even hope to see her again. I will see you
again, then, O sweet and confiding Clementine&mdash;best of spouses,
and, probably, of mothers! What do I say? I see her now! My eyes do
not deceive me! This is surely she! There she is, just as I left her!
Clementine! In my arms! On my heart! Look here! What's this you've
been whining to me, the rest of you? Napoleon is not dead, and the
world has not grown forty-six years older, for Clementine is still the
same!"</p>

<p>The betrothed of Leon Renault was about entering the room, and
stopped petrified at finding herself so overwhelmingly received by the
Colonel.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>THE GAME OF LOVE AND WAR.</h3>


<p>As she was evidently backward in falling into his arms, Fougas
imitated Mahomet, and ran to the mountain.</p>

<p>"Oh, Clementine!" said he, covering her with kisses, "the friendly
Fates give you back to my devotion. I clasp once more the partner of
my life and the mother of my child!"</p>

<p>The young lady was so astounded, that she did not even dream of
defending herself. Happily, Leon Renault extricated her from the hands
of the Colonel, and placed himself between them, determined to defend
his own.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," cried he, clenching his fists, "you deceive yourself
entirely, if you think you know <i>Mademoiselle</i>. She is not a
person of your time, but of ours; she is not
your <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>, but mine; she has never been the mother of
your child, and I trust that she will be the mother of mine!"</p>

<p>Fougas was iron. He seized his rival by the arm, sent him off
spinning like a top, and put himself face to face with the young
girl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg
127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you Clementine?" he demanded of her.</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"I call you all to witness that she is my Clementine!"</p>

<p>Leon returned to the charge, and seized the Colonel by the collar,
at the risk of getting himself dashed against the walls.</p>

<p>"We've had joking enough!" said he. "Possibly you don't pretend to
monopolize all the Clementines in the world? Mademoiselle's name is
Clementine Sambucco; she was born at Martinique, where you never set
your foot, if I am to believe what you have said within an hour. She
is eighteen years old&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So was the other!"</p>

<p>"Eh! The other is sixty-four to-day, since she was eighteen in
1813. Mlle. Sambucco is of an honorable and well-known family. Her
father, M. Sambucco, was a magistrate; her grandfather was a
functionary of the war department. You see, she is in no way connected
with you, nearly or remotely; and good sense and politeness, to say
nothing of gratitude, make it your duty to leave her in peace."</p>

<p>He gave the Colonel a shove, in his turn, and made him tumble
between the arms of a sofa.</p>

<p>Fougas bounded up as if he had been thrown on a million springs.
But Clementine stopped him, with a gesture and a smile.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said she in her most caressing voice, "do not get angry
with him; he loves me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128"
id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"So much the more reason why I should! Damnation!"</p>

<p>He cooled down, nevertheless, made the young lady sit down beside
him, and regarded her from head to foot with the most absorbed
attention.</p>

<p>"This is surely she," said he. "My memory, my eyes, my heart,
everything in me, recognizes her, and tells me that it is she. And
nevertheless the testimony of mankind, the calculation of times and
distances, in a word, the very soul of evidence, seems to have made it
a special point to convict me of error.</p>

<p>"Is it possible, then, that two women should so resemble each
other? Am I the victim of an illusion of the senses? Have I recovered
life only to lose reason? No; I know myself, I find myself the same;
my judgment is firm and accurate, and can make its way in this world
so new and topsy-turvy. It is on but one point that my reason
wavers&mdash;Clementine!&mdash;I seem to see you again, and you are
not you! Well, what's the difference, after all? If the Destiny which
snatched me from the tomb has taken care to present to my awaking
sense the image of her I loved, it must be because it had resolved to
give me back, one after another, all the blessings which I had lost.
In a few days, my epaulettes; to-morrow, the flag of the 23d of the
line; to-day this adorable presence which made my heart beat for the
first time! Living image of all that is sweetest and clearest in the
past, I throw myself at your feet! Be my
wife!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg
129]</a></span></p>

<p>The devil of a fellow joined the deed to the word, and the
witnesses of the unexpected scene opened their eyes to the widest. But
Clementine's aunt, the austere Mlle. Sambucco, thought that it was
time to show her authority. She stretched out her big, wrinkled hands,
seized Fougas, jerked him sharply to his feet, and cried in her
shrillest voice:</p>

<p>"Enough, sir; it is time to put an end to this scandalous farce! My
niece is not for you; I have promised her and given her away. Know
that, day after to-morrow, the 19th of this month, at ten o'clock in
the morning, she will marry M. Leon Renault, your benefactor!"</p>

<p>"And I forbid it&mdash;do you hear, Madame Aunt? And if she
pretends to marry this boy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What will you do?"</p>

<p>"I'll curse her!"</p>

<p>Leon could not help laughing. The malediction of this
twenty-five-year-old Colonel appeared rather more comic than terrible.
But Clementine grew pale, burst into tears, and fell, in her turn, at
the feet of Fougas.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," cried she, kissing his hands, "do not overwhelm a poor
girl who venerates you, who loves you, who will sacrifice her
happiness if you demand it! By all the marks of tenderness which I
have lavished upon you for a month, by the tears I have poured upon
your coffin, by the respectful zeal with which I have urged on your
resuscitation, I conjure you to pardon our offences. I will not marry
Leon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg
130]</a></span> if you forbid me; I will do anything to please you; I
will obey you in everything; but, for God's sake, do not pour upon me
your maledictions!"</p>

<p>"Embrace me," said Fougas. "You yield; I pardon."</p>

<p>Clementine raised herself, all radiant with joy, and held up her
beautiful forehead. The stupefaction of the spectators, especially of
those most interested, can be better imagined than described. An old
mummy dictating laws, breaking off marriages, and imposing his desires
on the whole house! Pretty little Clementine, so reasonable, so
obedient, so happy in the prospect of marrying Leon Renault,
sacrificing, all at once, her affections, her happiness, and almost
her duty, to the caprice of an interloper. M. Nibor declared that it
was madness. As for Leon, he would have butted his head into all the
walls, if his mother had not held him back.</p>

<p>"Ah, my poor child!" said she, "why did you bring that thing from
Berlin?"</p>

<p>"It's my fault!" cried old Monsieur Renault.</p>

<p>"No," interrupted Dr. Martout, "it's mine."</p>

<p>The members of the Parisian committee discussed with M. Rollon the
new aspect of the case. "Had they resuscitated a madman? Had the
revivification produced some disorder of the nervous system? Had the
abuse of wine and other drinkables during the first repast caused a
delirium? What an interesting autopsy it would be, if they could
dissect M. Fougas at the next regular
meeting!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg
131]</a></span></p>

<p>"You would do very well as far as you would go, gentlemen," said
the Colonel of the 23d. "The autopsy might explain the delirium of our
unfortunate friend, but it would not account for the impression
produced upon the young lady. Is it fascination, magnetism, or
what?"</p>

<p>While the friends and relations were weeping, counselling, and
buzzing around him, Fougas, serene and smiling, gazed at himself in
Clementine's eyes, while they, too, regarded him tenderly.</p>

<p>"This must be brought to an end!" cried Mlle. Sambucco the severe.
"Come, Clementine!"</p>

<p>Fougas seemed surprised.</p>

<p>"She doesn't live here, then?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; she lives with me."</p>

<p>"Then I will escort her home. Angel! will you take my arm?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Monsieur, with great pleasure!"</p>

<p>Leon gnashed his teeth.</p>

<p>"This is admirable! He presumes on such familiarity, and she takes
it all as a matter of course!"</p>

<p>He went to get his hat, for the purpose of, at least, going home
with the aunt, but his hat was not in its place; Fougas, who had not
yet one of his own, had helped himself to it without ceremony. The
poor lover crowded his head into a cap, and followed Fougas and
Clementine, with the respectable Virginie, whose arm cut like a
scythe.</p>

<p>By an accident which happened almost daily, the Colonel of
cuirassiers met Clementine on the
way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg
132]</a></span> home. The young lady directed Fougas' attention to
him.</p>

<p>"That's M. du Marnet," said she. "His restaurant is at the end of
our street, and his room at the side of the park. I think he is very
much taken with my little self, but he has never even bowed to me. The
only man for whom my heart has ever beaten is Leon Renault."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! And me?" said Fougas.</p>

<p>"Oh! as for you, that's another matter. I respect you, and stand in
awe of you. It seems to me as if you were a good and respectable
parent."</p>

<p>"Thank you!"</p>

<p>"I'm telling you the truth, as far as I can read it in my heart.
All this is not very clear, I confess, but I do not understand
myself."</p>

<p>"Azure flower of innocence, I adore your sweet perplexity! Let love
take care of itself; it will speak to you in master tones."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that; it's possible! Here we are at
home. Good evening, Monsieur; embrace me.&mdash;Good night, Leon;
don't quarrel with M. Fougas. I love him with all my heart, but I love
you in a different way!"</p>

<p>The aunt Virginie made no response to the "Good evening" of Fougas.
When the two men were alone in the street, Leon marched along without
saying a word, till they reached the next lamp-post. There, planting
himself resolutely opposite the Colonel, he
said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg
133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, sir, now that we are alone, we had better have an
explanation. I don't know by what philter or incantation you have
obtained such prodigious influence over my betrothed; but I know that
I love her, that I have been loved by her more than four years, and
that I will not stop at any means of retaining and protecting
her."</p>

<p>"Friend," answered Fougas, "you can brave me with impunity; my arm
is chained by gratitude. It shall never be written in history that
Pierre Fougas was an ingrate!"</p>

<p>"Would it have been more ungrateful in you to cut my throat, than
to rob me of my wife?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my benefactor! Learn to understand and pardon! God forbid that
I should marry Clementine in spite of you, in spite of herself. It is
through her consent and your own that I hope to win her. Realize that
she has been dear to me, not for four years, as to you, but for nearly
half a century. Reflect that I am alone on earth, and that her sweet
face is my only consolation. Will you, who have given me life, prevent
my spending it happily? Have you called me back to the world only to
deliver me over to despair?&mdash;Tiger! Take back, then, the life you
gave me, if you will not permit me to consecrate it to the adorable
Clementine!"</p>

<p>"Upon my soul, my dear fellow, you are superb! The habit of victory
must have totally twisted your wits. My hat is on your
head:&mdash;keep it; so far so good. But because my betrothed happens
to remind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg
134]</a></span> you vaguely of a girl in Nancy, must I give her up to
you? I can't see it!"</p>

<p>"Friend, I will give you back your hat just as soon as you've
bought me another one; but do not ask me to give up Clementine. In the
first place, do you know that she will reject me?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it."</p>

<p>"She loves me."</p>

<p>"You're crazy!"</p>

<p>"You've seen her at my feet."</p>

<p>"What of that? It was from fear, from respect, from superstition,
from anything in the devil's name you choose to call it; but it was
not from love."</p>

<p>"We'll see about that pretty clearly, after six months of married
life."</p>

<p>"But," cried Leon Renault, "have you the right to dispose of
yourself? There is another Clementine, the true one; she has
sacrificed everything for you; you are engaged, in honor, to her. Is
Colonel Fougas deaf to the voice of honor?"</p>

<p>"Are you mocking me? What! I marry a woman sixty-four years
old?"</p>

<p>"You ought to; if not for her sake, at least for your child's."</p>

<p>"My child is a pretty big boy. He's forty-six years old; he has no
further need of my care."</p>

<p>"He does need your name, though."</p>

<p>"I'll adopt him."</p>

<p>"The law is opposed to it. You're not fifty
years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg
135]</a></span> old, and he's not fifteen years younger than you are;
quite the reverse!"</p>

<p>"Very well; I'll legitimize him by marrying the young
Clementine."</p>

<p>"How can you expect her to acknowledge a child twice as old as she
is herself?"</p>

<p>"But then I can't acknowledge him any better; so there's no need of
my marrying the old woman. Moreover, I'd be excessively accommodating
to break my head for a child who is very likely dead. What do I say?
It is possible that he never saw the light. I love and am
loved&mdash;that much is substantial and certain; and you shall be my
groomsman."</p>

<p>"Not yet awhile. Mlle. Sambucco is a minor, and her guardian is my
father."</p>

<p>"Your father is an honorable man; and he will not have the baseness
to refuse her to me."</p>

<p>"At least he will ask you if you have any position, any rank, any
fortune to offer to his ward."</p>

<p>"My position? colonel; my rank? colonel; my fortune? the pay of a
colonel. And the millions at Dantzic&mdash;I mustn't forget
them!&mdash;Here we are at home; let me have the will of that good old
gentleman who wore the lilac wig. Give me some books on history,
too&mdash;a big pile of them&mdash;all that have anything to say about
Napoleon."</p>

<p>Young Renault sadly obeyed the master he had given himself. He
conducted Fougas to a fine chamber, brought him Herr Meiser's will and
a whole shelf of books, and bid his mortal enemy
"Good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg
136]</a></span> night." The Colonel embraced him impetuously, and said
to him,</p>

<p>"I will never forget that to you I owe life and Clementine.
Farewell till to-morrow, noble and generous child of my native land!
farewell!"</p>

<p>Leon went back to the ground floor, passed the dining-room, where
Gothon was wiping the glasses and putting the silver in order, and
rejoined his father and mother, who were waiting for him in the
parlor. The guests were gone, the candles extinguished. A single lamp
lit up the solitude. The two mandarins on the &eacute;tag&egrave;re
were motionless in their obscure corner, and seemed to meditate
gravely on the caprices of fortune.</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded Mme. Renault.</p>

<p>"I left him in his room, crazier and more obstinate than ever.
However, I've got an idea."</p>

<p>"So much the better," said the father, "for we have none left.
Sadness has made us stupid. But, above all things, no quarrelling.
These soldiers of the empire used to be terrible swordsmen."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not afraid of him! It's Clementine that makes me anxious.
With what sweetness and submission she listened to the confounded
babbler!"</p>

<p>"The heart of woman is an unfathomable abyss. Well, what do you
think of doing?"</p>

<p>Leon developed in detail the project he had conceived in the
street, during his conversation with Fougas.</p>

<p>"The most urgent thing," said he, "is to
relieve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg
137]</a></span> Clementine from this influence. If we could get him
out of the way to-morrow, reason would resume its empire, and we would
be married the day after to-morrow. That being done, I'll answer for
the rest."</p>

<p>"But how is such a madman to be gotten rid of?"</p>

<p>"I see but one way, but it is almost infallible&mdash;to excite his
dominant passion. These fellows sometimes imagine that they are in
love, but, at the bottom, they love nothing but powder. The thing is,
to fling Fougas back into the current of military ideas. His breakfast
to-morrow with the colonel of the 23d will be a good preparation. I
made him understand to-day that he ought, before all, to reclaim his
rank and epaulettes, and he has become inoculated with the idea. He'll
go to Paris, then. Possibly he'll find there some leather-breeches of
his acquaintance. At all events, he'll re&euml;nter the service. The
occupations incident to his position will be a powerful diversion;
he'll no longer dream of Clementine, whom I will have fixed securely.
We will have to furnish him the wherewithal to knock about the world;
but all sacrifices of money are nothing in comparison with the
happiness I wish to save."</p>

<p>Madame Renault, who was a woman of thrift, blamed her son's
generosity a little.</p>

<p>"The Colonel is an ungrateful soul," said she. "We've already done
too much in giving him back his life. Let him take care of himself
now!"</p>

<p>"No," said the father; "we've not the right
to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg
138]</a></span> send him forth entirely empty-handed. Decency
forbids."</p>

<p>This deliberation, which had lasted a good hour and a quarter, was
interrupted by a tremendous racket. One would have declared that the
house was falling down.</p>

<p>"There he is again!" cried Leon. "Undoubtedly a fresh paroxysm of
raving madness!"</p>

<p>He ran, followed by his parents, and mounted the steps four at a
time. A candle was burning at the sill of the chamber door. Leon took
it, and pushed the door half open.</p>

<p>Must it be confessed? Hope and joy spoke louder to him than fear.
He fancied himself already relieved of the Colonel. But the spectacle
presented to his eyes suddenly diverted the course of his ideas, and
the inconsolable lover began laughing like a fool. A noise of kicks,
blows, and slaps; an undefined group rolling on the floor in the
convulsions of a desperate struggle&mdash;so much was all he could see
and understand at the first glance. Soon Fougas, lit up by the ruddy
glow of the candle, discovered that he was struggling with Gothon,
like Jacob with the angel, and went back, confused and pitiable, to
bed.</p>

<p>The Colonel had gone to sleep over the history of Napoleon, without
putting out the candle. Gothon, after finishing her work, saw the
light under the door. Her thoughts recurred to that poor Baptiste,
who, perhaps, was groaning in purgatory
for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg
139]</a></span> having let himself tumble from a roof. Hoping that
Fougas could give her some news of her lover, she rapped several
times, at first softly, then much louder. The Colonel's silence and
the lighted candle made it seem to the servant that there was
something wrong. The fire might catch the curtains, and from thence
the whole building. She accordingly set down the candle, opened the
door, and went, with cat-like steps, to put out the light. Possibly
the eyes of the sleeper vaguely perceived the passage of a shadow;
possibly Gothon, with her big, awkward figure, made a board in the
floor creak. Fougas partially awoke, heard the rustling of a dress,
dreamed it one of those adventures which were wont to spice garrison
life under the first empire, and held out his arms blindly, calling
Clementine. Gothon, on finding herself seized by the hair and
shoulders, responded by such a masculine blow that the enemy supposed
himself attacked by a man. The blow was returned with interest;
further exchanges followed, and they finished by clinching and rolling
on the floor.</p>

<p>If anybody ever did feel shamefaced, Fougas was certainly the man.
Gothon went to bed, considerably bruised; the Renault family talked
sense into the Colonel, and got out of him pretty much what they
wanted. He promised to set out next day, accepted as a loan the money
offered him, and swore not to return until he should have recovered
his epaulettes and secured the Dantzic bequest.</p>

<p>"And then," said he, "I'll marry
Clementine."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg
140]</a></span></p>

<p>On that point it was useless to argue with him; the idea was
fixed.</p>

<p>Everybody slept soundly in the mansion of the Renaults; the heads
of the house, because they had had three sleepless nights; Fougas and
Gothon, because each had been unmercifully pummelled; and the young
C&eacute;lestin, because he had drunk the heeltaps from all the
glasses.</p>

<p>The next morning M. Rollon came to know if Fougas were in a
condition to breakfast with him; he feared, just the least bit, that
he would find him under a shower bath. Far from it! The madman of
yesterday was as calm as a picture and as fresh as a rosebud. He
shaved with Leon's razors, while humming an air of Nicolo. With his
hosts, he was charming, and he promised to settle a pension on Gothon
out of Herr Meiser's legacy.</p>

<p>As soon as he had set off for the breakfast, Leon ran to the
dwelling of his sweetheart.</p>

<p>"Everything is going better," said he. "The Colonel is much more
reasonable. He has promised to leave for Paris this very day; so we
can get married to-morrow."</p>

<p>Mlle. Virginie Sambucco praised this plan of proceeding highly, not
only because she had made great preparations for the wedding, but
because the postponement of the marriage would be the talk of the
town. The cards were already out, the mayor notified, and the Virgin's
chapel, in the parish church, engaged. To revoke all this at the
caprice of a ghost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141"
id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> and a fool, would be to sin against
custom, common sense, and Heaven itself.</p>

<p>Clementine only replied with tears. She could not be happy without
marrying Leon, but she would rather die, she said, than give her hand
without the sanction of M. Fougas. She promised to implore him, on her
knees if necessary, and wring from him his consent.</p>

<p>"But if he refuses? And it's too likely that he will!"</p>

<p>"I will beseech him again and again, until he says yes."</p>

<p>Everybody conspired to convince her that she was
unreasonable&mdash;her aunt, Leon, M. and Mme. Renault, M. Martout, M.
Bonnivet, and all the friends of the two families. At length she
yielded, but, at almost the same instant, the door flew open, and M.
Audret rushed into the parlor, crying out,</p>

<p>"Well, well! here <i>is</i> a piece of news! Colonel Fougas is
going to fight M. du Marnet to-morrow."</p>

<p>The young girl fell, thunderstruck, into the arms of Leon
Renault.</p>

<p>"God punishes me!" cried she; "and the chastisement for my impiety
is not delayed. Will you still force me to obey you? Shall I be
dragged to the altar, in spite of myself, at the very hour he's
risking his life?"</p>

<p>No one dared to insist longer, on seeing her in so pitiable a
state. But Leon offered up earnest prayers that victory might side
with the colonel of cuiras<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142"
id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>siers. He was wrong, I confess; but
what lover would have been sinless enough to cast the first stone at
him?</p>

<p>And here is an account of how the precious Fougas had spent his
day.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock in the morning, the youngest two captains of the 23d
came to conduct him in proper style to the residence of the Colonel.
M. Rollon occupied a little palace of the imperial epoch. A marble
tablet, inserted over the porte-coch&egrave;re, still bore the
words, <i>Minist&egrave;re des Finances</i>&mdash;a souvenir of the
glorious time when Napoleon's court followed its master to
Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>Colonel Rollon, the lieutenant-colonel, the major-in-chief, the
three majors of battalions, the surgeon-major, and ten or a dozen
officers were outside, awaiting the arrival of the illustrious guest
from the other world. The flag was placed in the middle of the court,
under guard of the ensign and a squad of non-commissioned officers
selected for the honor. The band of the regiment, at the entrance of
the garden, filled up the background of the picture. Eight panoplies
of arms, which had been improvised the same morning by the armorers of
the corps, embellished the walls and railings. A company of
grenadiers, with their arms at rest, were in attendance.</p>

<p>At the entrance of Fougas, the band played the famous "<i>Partant
pour la Syrie;</i>" the grenadiers presented arms; the drums beat a
salute; the non-commissioned officers and soldiers cried, "<i>Vive
le<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg
143]</a></span> Colonel Fougas!</i>" the officers, in a body,
approached the patriarch of their regiment. All this was neither
regular nor according to discipline, but we can well allow a little
latitude to these brave soldiers on finding their ancestor. For them
it seemed a little debauch in glory.</p>

<p>The hero of the <i>f&ecirc;te</i> grasped the hands of the colonel
and officers with as much emotion as if he had found his old comrades
again. He cordially saluted the non-commissioned officers and
soldiers, approached the flag, bent one knee to the earth, raised
himself loftily, grasped the staff, turned toward the attentive crowd,
and said,</p>

<p>"My friends, under the shadow of the flag, a soldier of France,
after forty-six years of exile, finds his family again to-day. All
honor to thee, symbol of our fatherland, old partner in our victories,
and heroic support in our misfortunes! Thy radiant eagle has hovered
over prostrate and trembling Europe. Thy bruised eagle has again
dashed obstinately against misfortune, and terrified the sons of
Power. Honor to thee, thou who hast led us to glory, and fortified us
against the clamor of despair! I have seen thee ever foremost in the
fiercest dangers, proud flag of my native land! Men have fallen around
thee like grain before the reaper; while thou alone hast shown to the
enemy thy front unbending and superb. Bullets and cannon-shot have
torn thee with wounds, but never upon thee has the audacious stranger
placed his hand. May the future deck
thy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg
144]</a></span> front with new laurels! Mayst thou conquer new and
far-extending realms, which no fatality shall rob thee of! The day of
great deeds is being born again; believe a warrior, who has risen from
the tomb to tell thee so. 'Forward!' Yes, I swear it by the spirit of
him who led us at Wagram. There shall be great days for France when
thou shalt shelter with thy glorious folds the fortunes of the brave
23d!"</p>

<p>Eloquence so martial and patriotic stirred all hearts. Fougas was
applauded, f&ecirc;ted, embraced, and almost carried in triumph into
the banquet hall.</p>

<p>Seated at table opposite M. Rollon, as if he were a second master
of the house, he breakfasted heartily, talked a great deal, and drank
more yet. You may occasionally meet, in the world, people who get
drunk without drinking. Fougas was far from being one of them. He
never felt his equanimity seriously disturbed short of three bottles.
Often, in fact, he went much further without yielding.</p>

<p>The toasts presented at dessert were distinguished for pith and
cordiality. I would like to recount them in order, but am forced to
admit that they would take up too much room, and that the last, which
were the most touching, were not of a lucidity absolutely
Voltairian.</p>

<p>They arose from the table at two o'clock, and betook themselves in
a body to the <i>Caf&eacute; Militaire</i>, where the officers of the
23d placed a punch before the two colonels. They had invited, with a
feeling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg
145]</a></span> of eminent propriety, the superior officers of the
regiment of cuirassiers.</p>

<p>Fougas, who was drunker, in his own proper person, than a whole
battalion of <i>Suisses</i>, distributed a great many hand-shakings.
But across the storm which disturbed his spirit, he recognized the
person and name of M. du Marnet, and made a grimace. Between officers,
and, above all, between officers of different arms of the service,
politeness is a little excessive, etiquette rather
severe, <i>amour-propre</i> somewhat susceptible. M. du Marnet, who
was pre&euml;minently a man of the world, understood at once, from the
attitude of M. Fougas, that he was not in the presence of a
friend.</p>

<p>The punch appeared, blazing, went out with its strength unimpaired,
and was dispensed, with a big ladle, into threescore glasses. Fougas
drank with everybody, except M. du Marnet. The conversation, which was
erratic and noisy, imprudently raised a question of comparative
merits. An officer of cuirassiers asked Fougas if he had seen
Bordesoulle's splendid charge, which flung the Austrians into the
valley of Plauen. Fougas had known General Bordesoulle personally, and
had seen with his own eyes the beautiful heavy cavalry manoeuvre which
decided the victory of Dresden. But he chose to be disagreeable to M.
du Marnet, by affecting an air of ignorance or indifference.</p>

<p>"In our time," said he, "the cavalry was always brought into action
after the battle; we employ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146"
id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>ed it to bring in the enemy after we
had routed them."</p>

<p>Here a great outcry arose, and the glorious name of Murat was
thrown into the balance.</p>

<p>"Oh, doubtless&mdash;doubtless!" said he, shaking his head. "Murat
was a good general in his limited sphere; he answered perfectly for
all that was wanted of him. But if the cavalry had Murat, the infantry
had Napoleon."</p>

<p>M. du Marnet observed, judiciously, that Napoleon, if he must be
seized upon for the credit of any single arm of the service, would
belong to the artillery.</p>

<p>"With all my heart, monsieur," replied Fougas; "the artillery and
the infantry. Artillery at a distance, infantry at close
quarters&mdash;cavalry off at one side."</p>

<p>"Once more I beg your pardon," answered M. du Marnet; "you mean to
say, at the sides, which is a very different matter."</p>

<p>"At the sides, or at one side, I don't care! As for me, if I were
commander-in-chief, I would set the cavalry aside."</p>

<p>Several cavalry officers had already flung themselves into the
discussion. M. du Marnet held them back, and made a sign that he
wanted to answer Fougas alone.</p>

<p>"And why, then, if you please, would you set the cavalry
aside?"</p>

<p>"Because the dragoon is an incomplete
soldier."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg
147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Incomplete?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and the proof is, that the Government has to buy four or
five hundred francs' worth of horse in order to complete him. And when
the horse receives a ball or a bayonet thrust, the dragoon is no
longer good for anything. Have you ever seen a cavalryman on foot? It
would be a pretty sight!"</p>

<p>"I see myself on foot every day, and I don't see anything
particularly ridiculous about it."</p>

<p>"I'm too polite to contradict you."</p>

<p>"And for me, sir, I am too just to combat one paradox with another.
What would you think of my logic, if I were to say to you (the idea is
not mine&mdash;I found it in a book), if I were to say to you, 'I
entertain a high regard for infantry, but, after all, the foot soldier
is an incomplete soldier, deprived of his birthright, an inefficient
body deprived of that natural complement of the soldier, called a
horse! I admire his courage, I perceive that he makes himself useful
in battle; but, after all, the poor devil has only two feet at his
command, while we have four!' You see fit to consider a dragoon on
foot ridiculous; but does the foot-soldier always make a very
brilliant appearance when one sticks a horse between his legs? I have
seen excellent infantry captains cruelly embarrassed when the minister
of war made them majors. They said, scratching their heads, 'It's not
over when we've mounted a grade; we've got to mount a horse in the
bargain!'"</p>

<p>This crude pleasantry amused the audience for
a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg
148]</a></span> moment. They laughed, and the mustard mounted higher
and higher in Fougas' nose.</p>

<p>"In my time," said he, "a foot soldier became a dragoon in
twenty-four hours; and if any one would like to make a match with me
on horseback, sabre in hand, I'll show him what infantry is!"</p>

<p>"Monsieur," coolly replied M. du Marnet, "I hope that opportunities
will not be lacking to you in the field of battle. It is there that a
true soldier displays his talents and bravery. Infantry and cavalry,
we alike belong to France. I drink to her, Monsieur, and I hope you
will not refuse to touch glasses with me.&mdash;To France!"</p>

<p>This was certainly well spoken and well settled. The clicking of
glasses applauded M. du Marnet. Fougas himself approached his
adversary and drank with him without reserve. But he whispered in his
ear, speaking very thickly:</p>

<p>"I hope, for my part, that you will not refuse the sabre-match
which I had the honor to propose to you?"</p>

<p>"As you please," said the colonel of cuirassiers.</p>

<p>The gentleman from the other world, drunker than ever, went out of
the crowd with two officers whom he had picked up haphazard. He
declared to them that he considered himself insulted by M. du Marnet,
that a challenge had been given and accepted, and that the affair was
going on swimmingly.</p>

<p>"Especially,"added he in confidence, "since there is a lady in the
case! These are my
conditions&mdash;they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149"
id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> are all in accordance with the honor
of the infantry, the army, and France: we will fight on horseback,
stripped to the waist, mounted bareback on two stallions. The
weapon&mdash;the cavalry sabre. First blood. I want to chastise a
puppy. I am far from wishing to rob France of a soldier."</p>

<p>These conditions were pronounced absurd by M. du Marnet's seconds.
They accepted them, nevertheless, for the military code requires one
to face all dangers, however absurd.</p>

<p>Fougas devoted the rest of the day to worrying the poor Renaults.
Proud of the control he exercised over Clementine, he declared his
wishes; swore he would take her for his wife as soon as he had
recovered his rank, family, and fortune, and prohibited her to dispose
of herself before that time. He broke openly with Leon and his
parents, refused to accept their good offices any longer, and quitted
their house after a serious passage of high words. Leon concluded by
saying that he would only give up his betrothed with life itself. The
Colonel shrugged his shoulders and turned his back, carrying off,
without stopping to consider what he was doing, the father's clothes
and the son's hat. He asked M. Rollon for five hundred francs, engaged
a room at the <i>Hotel du Cadron-bleu</i>, went to bed without any
supper, and slept straight through until the arrival of his
seconds.</p>

<p>There was no necessity for giving him an account of what had passed
the previous day. The fogs of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150"
id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> punch and sleep dissipated
themselves in an instant. He plunged his head and hands into a basin
of fresh water, and said:</p>

<p>"So much for my toilet! Now, <i>Vive l'Empereur!</i> Let's go and
get "into line!"</p>

<p>The field selected by common consent was the parade-ground&mdash;a
sandy plain enclosed in the forest, at a good distance from the town.
All the officers of the garrison betook themselves there of their own
accord; there would have been no need of inviting them. More than one
soldier went secretly and billeted himself in a tree.
The <i>gendarmerie</i> itself ornamented the little
family <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, with its presence. People went to see an
encounter in chivalric tourney, not merely between the infantry and
the cavalry, but between the old army and the young. The exhibition
fully satisfied public expectation. No one was tempted to hiss the
piece, and everybody had his money's worth.</p>

<p>Precisely at nine o'clock, the combatants entered the lists,
attended by their four seconds and the umpire of the field. Fougas,
naked to the waist, was as handsome as a young god. His lithe and
agile figure, his proud and radiant features, the manly grace of his
movements, assured him a flattering reception. He made his English
horse caper, and saluted the lookers-on with the point of his
sword.</p>

<p>M. du Marnet, a man rather of the German type, hardy, quite hairy,
moulded like the Indian Bacchus, and not like Achilles, showed in his
countenance a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151"
id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> slight shade of disgust. It was not
necessary to be a magician to understand that this duel <i>in
naturalibus</i>, under the eyes of his own officers, appeared to him
useless and even ridiculous. His horse was a half-blood from Perche, a
vigorous beast and full of fire.</p>

<p>Fougas' seconds rode badly enough. They divided their attention
between the combat and their stirrups. M. du Marnet had chosen the
best two horsemen in his regiment, a major and captain. The umpire of
the field was Colonel Rollon, an excellent rider.</p>

<p>At a signal given by Colonel Rollon, Fougas rode directly at his
adversary, presenting the point of his sabre in the position of
"prime," like a cavalry soldier charging infantry in a hollow square.
But he reined up about three lengths from M. du Marnet, and described
around him seven or eight rapid circles, like an Arab in a play. M. du
Marnet, being forced to turn in the same spot and defend himself on
all sides, clapped both spurs to his horse, broke the circle, took to
the field, and threatened to commence the same manoeuvre about Fougas.
But the gentleman from the other world did not wait for him. He rushed
off at a full gallop, and made a round of the hippodrome, always
followed by M. du Marnet. The cuirassier, being heavier, and mounted
on a slower horse, was distanced. He revenged himself by calling out
to Fougas:</p>

<p>"Oh, Monsieur! I must say that this looks
more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg
152]</a></span> like a race than a battle. I ought to have brought a
riding-whip instead of a sword!"</p>

<p>But Fougas, panting and furious, had already turned upon him.</p>

<p>"Hold on there!" cried he; "I have shown you the horseman; now I
will show you the soldier!"</p>

<p>He lanched a thrust at him, which would have gone through him like
a hoop if M. du Marnet had not been as prompt as at parade. He
retorted by a fine cut <i>en quarte</i>, powerful enough to cut the
invincible Fougas in two. But the other was nimbler than a monkey. He
wholly shielded his body by letting himself slide to the ground, and
then remounted his horse in the same second.</p>

<p>"My compliments!" said M. du Marnet. "They don't do any better than
that in the circus."</p>

<p>"No more do they in war," rejoined the other. "Ah, scoundrel! so
you revile the old army? Here's at you! A miss! Thanks for the retort,
but it's not good enough yet. I'll not die from any such thrust as
that! How do you like that?&mdash;and that?-and that? Ah, you claim
that the foot-soldier is an incomplete man! Now we're going to
make <i>your</i> assortment of limbs a little incomplete. Look out for
your boot! He's parried it! Perhaps he expects to indulge in a little
promenade under Clementine's windows this evening. Take care! Here's
for Clementine! And here's for the infantry! Will you parry that? So,
traitor! And that? So he does!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153"
id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> Perhaps you'll parry them all, then,
by Heavens! Victory! Ah, Monsieur! Your blood is flowing! What have I
done? Devil take the sword, the horse, and all! Major! major! come
quickly! Monsieur, let yourself rest in my arms. Beast that I am! As
if all soldiers were not brothers! Oh, forgive me, my friend! Would
that I could redeem each drop of your blood with all of mine!
Miserable Fougas, incapable of mastering his fierce passions! Ah, you
Esculapian Mars, I beg you tell me that the thread of his days is not
to be clipped! I will not survive him, for he is a brave!"</p>

<p>M. du Marnet had received a magnificent cut which traversed the
left arm and breast, and the blood was streaming from it at a rate to
make one shudder. The surgeon, who had provided himself with
hemostatic preparations, hastened to arrest the hemorrhage. The wound
was long rather than deep, and could be cured in a few days. Fougas
himself carried his adversary to the carriage, but that did not
satisfy him. He firmly insisted on joining the two officers who took
M. du Marnet home; he overwhelmed the wounded man with his
protestations, and was occupied during most of the ride in swearing
eternal friendship to him. On reaching the house, he put him to bed,
embraced him, bathed him with tears, and did not leave him for a
moment until he heard him snoring.</p>

<p>When six o'clock struck, he went to dine at
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg
154]</a></span> hotel, in company with his seconds and the referee,
all of whom he had invited after the fight. He treated them
magnificently, and got drunk himself, as
usual.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH THE READER WILL SEE THAT IT IS NOT FAR FROM THE CAPITAL TO
THE TARPEIAN ROCK.</h3>


<p>The next day, after a visit to M. du Marnet, he wrote thus to
Clementine:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Light of my life, I am about to quit these scenes, the
witnesses of my fatal courage and the repositories of my love. To the
bosom of the capital, to the foot of the throne, I will first betake
my steps. If the successor of the God of Combats is not deaf to the
voice of the blood that courses in his veins, he will restore me my
sword and epaulettes, so that I may lay them at thy feet. Be faithful
to me&mdash;wait, hope! May these lines be to thee a talisman against
the dangers threatening thy independence. Oh, my Clementine, tenderly
guard thyself for thy </p></blockquote>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Victor
Fougas!</span>"</span><br>
</p>

<p>Clementine sent him no answer, but, just as he was getting on the
train, he was accosted by a messenger, who handed him a pretty red
leather pocket-book, and ran away with all his might. The pocket-book
was entirely new, solid, and carefully fastened. It contained twelve
hundred francs in bank notes&mdash;all the young girl's savings.
Fougas had no time to deliberate on this delicate circumstance. He
was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg
156]</a></span> pushed into a car, the locomotive puffed, and the
train started.</p>

<p>The Colonel began to review in his memory the various events which
had succeeded each other in his life during less than a week. His
arrest among the frosts of the Vistula, his sentence to death, his
imprisonment in the fortress of Liebenfeld, his reawakening at
Fontainebleau, the invasion of 1814, the return from the island of
Elba, the hundred days, the death of the emperor and the king of Rome,
the restoration of the Bonapartes in 1852, his meeting with a young
girl who was the counterpart of Clementine Pichon in all respects, the
flag of the 23d, the duel with the colonel of cuirassiers&mdash;all
this, for Fougas, had not taken up more than four days. The night
reaching from the 11th of November, 1813, to the 17th of August, 1859,
seemed to him even a little shorter than any of the others; for it was
the only time that he had had a full sleep, without any dreaming.</p>

<p>A less active spirit, and a heart less warm, would, perhaps, have
lapsed into a sort of melancholy. For, in fact, one who has been
asleep for forty-six years would naturally become somewhat alien to
mankind in general, even in his own country. Not a relation, not a
friend, not a familiar face, on the whole face of the earth! Add to
this a multitude of new words, ideas, customs, and inventions, which
make him feel the need of a cicerone, and prove to him that he is a
stranger. But Fougas, on reopening
his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg
157]</a></span> eyes, following the precept of Horace, was thrown into
the very midst of action. He had improvised for him friends, enemies,
a sweetheart, and a rival. Fontainebleau, his second native place,
was, provisionally, the central point of his existence. There he felt
himself loved, hated, feared, admired&mdash;in a word, well known. He
knew that in that sub-prefecture his name could not be spoken without
awakening an echo. But what attached him more than all to modern
times, was his well-established relationship with the great family of
the army. Wherever a French flag floats, the soldier, young or old, is
at home. Around that church-spire of the fatherland, though dear and
sacred in a way different from the village spire, language, ideas, and
institutions change but little. The death of individuals has little
effect; they are replaced by others who look like them, and think,
talk, and act in the same way; who do not stop on assuming the uniform
of their predecessors, but inherit their souvenirs also&mdash;the
glory they have acquired, their traditions, their jests, and even
certain intonations of their voices. This accounts for Fougas' sudden
friendship, after a first feeling of jealousy, for the new colonel of
the 23d; and the sudden sympathy which he evinced for M. du Marnet as
soon as he saw the blood running from his wound. Quarrels between
soldiers are family quarrels, which never blot out the
relationship.</p>

<p>Calmly satisfied that he was not alone in the world, M. Fougas
derived pleasure from all the
new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg
158]</a></span> objects which civilization placed before his eyes. The
speed of the rail-cars fairly intoxicated him. He was inspired with a
positive enthusiasm for this force of steam, whose theory was a closed
book to him, but on whose results he meditated much.</p>

<p>"With a thousand machines like this, two thousand rifled cannon,
and two hundred thousand such chaps as I am, Napoleon would have
conquered the world in six weeks. Why doesn't this young fellow on the
throne make some use of the resources he has under his control?
Perhaps he hasn't thought of it. Very well, I'll go to see him. If he
looks like a man of capacity, I'll give him my idea; he'll make me
minister of war, and then&mdash;Forward, march!"</p>

<p>He had explained to him the use of the great iron wires running on
poles all along the road.</p>

<p>"The very thing!" said he. "Here are aides-de-camp both fleet and
judicious. Get them all into the hands of a chief-of-staff like
Berthier, and the universe would be held in a thread by the mere will
of a man!"</p>

<p>His meditations were interrupted, a couple of miles from Melun, by
the sounds of a foreign language. He pricked up his ears, and then
bounded from his corner as if he had sat on a pile of thorns. Horror!
it was English! One of those monsters who had assassinated Napoleon at
St. Helena for the sake of insuring to themselves the cotton monopoly,
had entered the compartment with a very pretty woman and two lovely
children.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg
159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Conductor, stop!" cried Fougas, thrusting his body halfway out of
the window.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said the Englishman in good French, "I advise you to
have patience until we get to the next station. The conductor doesn't
hear you, and you're in danger of falling out on the track. If I can
be of any service to you, I have a flask of brandy with me, and a
medicine chest."</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Fougas in a most supercilious tone, "I'm in want
of nothing, and I'd rather die than accept anything from an
Englishman! If I'm calling the conductor, it's only because I want to
get into a different car, and cleanse my eyes from the sight of an
enemy of the Emperor."</p>

<p>"I assure you, monsieur," responded the Englishman, "that I am not
an enemy of the Emperor. I had the honor of being received by him
while he was in London. He even deigned to pass a few days at my
little country-seat in Lancashire."</p>

<p>"So much the better for you, if this young man is good enough to
forget what you have done against his family; but Fougas will never
forgive your crimes against his country."</p>

<p>As soon as they arrived at the station at Melun, he opened the door
and rushed into another saloon. There he found himself alone in the
presence of two young gentlemen, whose physiognomies were far from
English, and who spoke French with the purest accent of Touraine. Both
had coats of arms on their seal-rings, so that no one might be
ignorant of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160"
id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> rank as nobles. Fougas was too
plebeian to fancy the nobility much; but as he had left a compartment
full of Britons, he was happy to meet a couple of Frenchmen.</p>

<p>"Friends," said he, inclining toward them with a cordial smile, "we
are children of the same mother. Long life to you! Your appearance
revives me."</p>

<p>The two young gentlemen opened their eyes very wide, half bowed,
and resumed their conversation, without making any other response to
Fougas' advance.</p>

<p>"Well, then, my dear Astophe," said one, "you saw the king at
Froshdorf?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my good Americ; and he received me with the most affecting
condescension. 'Vicomte,' said he to me, 'you come of a house well
known for its fidelity. We will remember you when God replaces us on
the throne of our ancestors. Tell our brave nobility of Touraine that
we hope to be remembered in their prayers, and that we never forget
them in ours.'"</p>

<p>"Pitt and Coburg!" said Fougas between his teeth. "Here are two
little rascals conspiring with the army of Cond&eacute;! But,
patience!"</p>

<p>He clenched his fists and opened his ears.</p>

<p>"Didn't he say anything about politics?"</p>

<p>"A few vague words. Between us, I don't think he bothers with them
much; he is waiting upon events."</p>

<p>"He'll not wait much
longer."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg
161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who can tell?"</p>

<p>"What! Who can tell? The empire is not good for six months longer.
Monseigneur de Montereau said so again last Monday to my aunt the
canoness."</p>

<p>"For my part, I give them a year, for their campaign in Italy has
strengthened them with the lower orders. I didn't put myself out to
tell the king so, though!"</p>

<p>"Damnation! gentlemen, this is going it a little too strongly!"
interrupted Fougas. "Is it here in France that Frenchmen speak thus of
French institutions? Go back to your master; tell him that the empire
is eternal, because it is founded on the granite of popular support,
and cemented by the blood of heroes. And if the king asks you who told
you this, tell him it was Colonel Fougas, who was decorated at Wagram
by the Emperor's own hand!"</p>

<p>The two young gentlemen looked at each other, exchanged a smile,
and the Viscount said to the Marquis:</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"A madman."</p>

<p>"No, dear; a mad dog."</p>

<p>"Nothing else."<a name="FNanchor_6_6"
id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p>"Very well, gentlemen," cried the Colonel. "Speak English; you're
fit for it!"</p>

<p>He changed his compartment at the next station, and fell in with a
lot of young painters. He called them disciples of Zeuxis, and asked
them about G&eacute;rard, Gros, and David. These gentlemen
found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg
162]</a></span> the sport novel, and recommended him to go and see
Talma in the new tragedy of Arnault.</p>

<p>The fortifications of Paris dazzled him very much, and scandalized
him a little.</p>

<p>"I don't like this," said he to his companions. "The true rampart
of a capital is the courage of a great people. This piling bastions
around Paris, is saying to the enemy that it is possible to conquer
France."</p>

<p>The train at last stopped at the Mazas station. The Colonel, who
had no baggage, marched out pompously, with his hands in his pockets,
to look for the <i>h&ocirc;tel de Nantes</i>. As he had spent three
months in Paris about the year 1810, he considered himself acquainted
with the city, and for that reason he did not fail to lose himself as
soon as he got there. But in the various quarters which he traversed
at hazard, he admired the great changes which had been wrought during
his absence. Fougas' taste was for having streets very long, very
wide, and bordered with very large houses all alike; he could not fail
to notice that the Parisian style was rapidly approaching his ideal.
It was not yet absolute perfection, but progress was manifest.</p>

<p>By a very natural illusion, he paused twenty times to salute people
of familiar appearance; but no one recognized him.</p>

<p>After a walk of five hours he reached the <i>Place du
Carrousel</i>. The
<i>h&ocirc;tel de Nantes</i> was no longer there; but the Louvre had been erected
instead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> Fougas employed a quarter of an hour in regarding this
monument of architecture, and half an hour in contemplating two Zouaves
of the guard who were playing piquet. He inquired if the Emperor was in
Paris; whereupon his attention was called to the flag floating over the
Tuilleries.</p>

<p>"Good!" said he. "But first I must get some new clothes."</p>

<p>He took a room in a hotel on the <i>Rue Saint Honor&eacute;</i>,
and asked a waiter which was the most celebrated tailor in Paris. The
waiter handed him a Business Directory. Fougas hunted out the
Emperor's bootmaker, shirtmaker, hatter, tailor, barber, and
glovemaker. He took down their names and addresses in Clementine's
pocket-book, after which he took a carriage and set out.</p>

<p>As he had a small and shapely foot, he found boots ready-made
without any difficulty. He was promised, too, that all the linen he
required should be sent home in the evening. But when he came to
explain to the hatter what sort of an apparatus he intended to plant
on his head, he encountered great difficulties. His ideal was an
enormous hat, large at the crown, small below, broad in the brim, and
curved far down behind and before; in a word, the historic heirloom to
which the founder of Bolivia gave his name long ago. The shop had to
be turned upside down, and all its recesses searched, to find what he
wanted.</p>

<p>"At last," cried the hatter, "here's your
article.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg
164]</a></span> If it's for a stage dress, you ought to be satisfied;
the comic effect can be depended upon."</p>

<p>Fougas answered dryly, that the hat was much less ridiculous than
all those which were then circulating around the streets of Paris.</p>

<p>At the celebrated tailor's, in the <i>Rue de la Paix</i>, there was
almost a battle.</p>

<p>"No, monsieur," said Alfred, "I'll never make you a frogged surtout
and a pair of trousers <i>&agrave; la Cosaque</i>! Go to Babin, or
Morean, if you want a carnival dress; but it shall never be said that
a man of as good figure as yours left our establishment
caricatured."</p>

<p>"Thunder and guns!" retorted Fougas. "You're a head taller than I
am, Mister Giant, but I'm a colonel of the Grand Empire, and it won't
do for drum-majors to give orders to colonels!"</p>

<p>Of course, the devil of a fellow had the last word. His measure was
taken, a book of costumes consulted, and a promise made that in
twenty-four hours he should be dressed in the height of the fashion of
1813. Cloths were presented for his selection, among them some English
fabrics. These he threw aside with disgust.</p>

<p>"The blue cloth of France," cried he, "and made in France! And cut
it in such a style that any one seeing me in Pekin would say, 'That's
a soldier!'"</p>

<p>The officers of our day have precisely the opposite fancy. They
make an effort to resemble all other "gentlemen"<a name="FNanchor_7_7"
id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[7]</sup></a> when they assume the civilian's
dress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg
165]</a></span></p>

<p>Fougas ordered, in the <i>Rue Richelieu</i>, a black satin scarf,
which hid his shirt, and reached up to his ears. Then he went toward
the <i>Palais Royal</i>, entered a celebrated restaurant, and ordered
his dinner. For breakfast he had only taken a bite at a pastry-cook's
in the
<i>Boulevard</i>, so his appetite, which had been sharpened by the excursion,
did wonders. He ate and drank as he did at Fontainebleau. But the bill
seemed to him hard to digest: it was for a hundred and ten francs and a
few centimes. "The devil!" said he; "living has become dear in Paris!"
Brandy entered into the sum total for an item of nine francs. They had
given him a bottle, and a glass about the size of a thimble; this
gimcrack had amused Fougas, and he diverted himself by filling and
emptying it a dozen times. But on leaving the table he was not drunk; an
amiable gayety inspired him, but nothing more. It occurred to him to get
back some of his money by buying some lottery tickets at Number 113. But
a bottle-seller located in that building apprised him that France had
not gambled for thirty years. He pushed on to the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais</i>, to
see if the Emperor's actors might not be giving some fine tragedy, but
the poster disgusted him. Modern comedies played by new actors! Neither
Talma, nor Fleury, nor Th&eacute;nard, nor the Baptistes, nor Mlle. Mars, nor
Mlle. Raucourt! He then went to the opera, where Charles VI. was being
given. The music astounded him at once. He was not accustomed to hear so
much noise anywhere but on the bat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>tle-field. Nevertheless, his ears
soon inured themselves to the clangor of the instruments; and the
fatigue of the day, the pleasure of being comfortably seated, and the
labor of digestion, plunged him into a doze. He woke up with a start at
this famous patriotic song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"_Guerre aux tyrans! jamais, jamais en France,_<br></span>
<span class="i0">_Jamais l'Anglais ne r&eacute;gnera!_"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>"No!" cried he, stretching out his arms toward the stage. "Never!
Let us swear it together on the sacred altar of our native land!
Perish, perfidious Albion! <i>Vive l'Empereur!</i>"</p>

<p>The pit and orchestra arose at once, less to express accord with
Fougas' sentiments, than to silence him. During the
following <i>entr'acte</i>, a commissioner of police said in his ear,
that when one had dined as he had, one ought to go quietly to bed,
instead of interrupting the performance of the opera.</p>

<p>He replied that he had dined as usual, and that this explosion of
patriotic sentiment had not proceeded from the stomach.</p>

<p>"But," said he, "when, in this palace of misused magnificence,
hatred of the enemy is stigmatized as a crime, I must go and breathe a
freer air, and bow before the temple of Glory before I go to bed."</p>

<p>"You'll do well to do so," said the policeman.</p>

<p>He went out, haughtier and more erect than ever, reached the
Boulevard, and ran with great strides as far as the Corinthian temple
at the end. While on his way, he greatly admired the lighting of the
city.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg
167]</a></span> M. Martout had explained to him the manufacture of
gas; he had not understood anything about it, but the glowing and
ruddy flame was an actual treat to his eyes.</p>

<p>As soon as he had reached the monument commanding the entrance to
the
<i>Rue Royale</i>, he stopped on the pavement, collected his thoughts for an
instant, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, Glory! Inspirer of great deeds, widow of the mighty conqueror
of Europe! receive the homage of thy devoted Victor Fougas! For thee I
have endured hunger, sweat, and frost, and eaten the most faithful of
horses. For thee I am ready to brave further perils, and again to face
death on every battle-field. I seek thee rather than happiness,
riches, or power. Reject not the offering of my heart and the
sacrifice of my blood! As the price of such devotion, I ask nothing
but a smile from thy eyes and a laurel from thy hand!"</p>

<p>This prayer went all glowing to the ears of <i>Saint Marie
Madeleine</i>, the patroness of the ex-temple of Glory. Thus the
purchaser of a chateau sometimes receives a letter addressed to the
original proprietor.</p>

<p>Fougas returned by the <i>Rue de la Paix</i> and the <i>Place
Vend&ocirc;me</i>, and saluted, in passing, the only familiar figure
he had yet found in Paris. The new costume of Napoleon on the column
did not displease him in any way. He preferred the cocked hat to a
crown, and the gray surtout to a theatrical
cloak.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg
168]</a></span></p>

<p>The night was restless. In the Colonel's brain a thousand diverse
projects crossed each other in all directions. He prepared the little
speech which he should make to the Emperor, going to sleep in the
middle of a phrase, and waking up with a start in the attempt to lay
hold on the idea which had so suddenly vanished. He put out and relit
his candle twenty times. The recollection of Clementine was
occasionally intermingled with dreams of war and political utopias.
But I must confess that the young girl's figure seldom got any higher
than the second place.</p>

<p>But if the night appeared too long, the morning seemed short in
proportion. The idea of meeting the new master of the empire face to
face, inspired and chilled him in turn. For an instant he hoped that
something would be lacking in his toilet&mdash;that some shopkeeper
would furnish him an honorable pretext for postponing his visit until
the next day. But everybody displayed the most desperate punctuality.
Precisely at noon, the trousers <i>&agrave; la Cosaque</i> and the
frogged surtout were on the foot of the bed opposite the famous
Bolivar hat.</p>

<p>"I may as well be dressing," said Fougas. "Possibly this young man
may not be at home. In that case I'll leave my name, and wait until he
sends for me."</p>

<p>He got himself up gorgeously in his own way, and, although it may
appear impossible to my readers, Fougas, in a black satin scarf and
frogged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg
169]</a></span> surtout, was not homely nor even ridiculous. His tall
figure, lithe build, lofty and impressive carriage, and brusque
movements, were all in a certain harmony with the costume of the olden
time. He appeared strange, and that was all. To keep his courage up,
he dropped into a restaurant, ate four cutlets, a loaf of bread, a
slice of cheese, and washed it all down with two bottles of wine. The
coffee and supplements brought him up to two o'clock, and that was the
time he had set for himself.</p>

<p>He tipped his hat slightly over one ear, buttoned his buckskin
gloves, coughed energetically two or three times before the sentinel
at the <i>Rue de Rivoli</i>, and marched bravely into the gate.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," cried the porter, "what do you want?"</p>

<p>"The Emperor!"</p>

<p>"Have you an audience letter?"</p>

<p>"Colonel Fougas does not need one. Go and ask references of him who
towers over the <i>Place Vend&ocirc;me</i>. He'll tell you that the
name of Fougas has always been a synonym for bravery and
fidelity."</p>

<p>"You knew the first Emperor?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my little joker; and I have talked with him just as I am
talking with you."</p>

<p>"Indeed! But how old are you then?"</p>

<p>"Seventy years on the dial-plate of time; twenty-four years on the
tablets of History!"</p>

<p>The porter raised his eyes to Heaven, and
murmured:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg
170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Still another! This makes the fourth for this week!"</p>

<p>He made a sign to a little gentleman in black, who was smoking his
pipe in the court of the Tuilleries. Then he said to Fougas, putting
his hand on his arm:</p>

<p>"So, my good friend, you want to see the Emperor?"</p>

<p>"I've already told you so, familiar individual!"</p>

<p>"Very well; you shall see him to-day. That gentleman going along
there with the pipe in his mouth, is the one who introduces visitors;
he will take care of you. But the Emperor is not in the Palace; he is
in the country. It's all the same to you, isn't it, if you do have to
go into the country?"</p>

<p>"What the devil do you suppose I care?"</p>

<p>"Only I don't suppose you care to go on foot. A carriage has
already been ordered for you. Come, my good fellow, get in, and be
reasonable!"</p>

<p>Two minutes later, Fougas, accompanied by a detective, was riding
to a police station.</p>

<p>His business was soon disposed of. The commissary who received him
was the same one who had spoken to him the previous evening at the
opera. A doctor was called, and gave the best verdict of monomania
that ever sent a man to Charenton. All this was done politely and
pleasantly, without a word which could put the Colonel on his guard or
give him a suspicion of the fate held in reserve for him. He merely
found the ceremonial rather long and
peculiar,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg
171]</a></span> and prepared on the spot several well-sounding
sentences, which he promised himself the honor of repeating to the
Emperor.</p>

<p>At last he was permitted to resume his route. The hack had been
kept waiting; the gentleman-usher relit his pipe, said three words to
the driver, and seated himself at the left of the Colonel. The
carriage set off at a trot, reached the <i>Boulevards</i>, and took
the direction of the Bastille. It had gotten opposite the <i>Porte
Saint-Martin</i>, and Fougas, with his head at the window, was
continuing the composition of his impromptu speech, when an open
carriage drawn by a pair of superb chestnuts passed, so to speak,
under his very nose. A portly man with a gray moustache turned his
head, and cried, "Fougas!"</p>

<p>Robinson Crusoe, discovering the human footprint on his island, was
not more astonished and delighted than our hero on hearing that cry of
"Fougas!" To open the door, jump out into the road, run to the
carriage, which had been stopped, fling himself into it at a single
bound, without the help of the step, and fall into the arms of the
portly gentleman with the gray moustache, was all the work of a
second. The barouche had long disappeared, when the detective at a
gallop, followed by his hack at a trot, traversed the line of
the <i>Boulevards</i>, asking all the policemen if they had not seen a
crazy man pass that way.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>THE MEMORABLE INTERVIEW BETWEEN COLONEL FOUGAS AND HIS MAJESTY THE
EMPEROR OF THE FRENCH.</h3>


<p>In falling upon the neck of the big man with the gray moustache,
Fougas supposed he was embracing Massena. He naturally intimated as
much to him, whereupon the owner of the barouche burst into a great
peal of laughter.</p>

<p>"Ah, my poor old boy," said he, "it's a long time since we buried
the 'Child of Victory!' Look me square in the face: I am Leblanc, of
the Russian campaign."</p>

<p>"Impossible! You little Leblanc?"</p>

<p>"Lieutenant in the 3d Artillery, who shared with you a million of
dangers and that famous piece of roast horse which you salted with
your tears."</p>

<p>"Well, upon my soul! It <i>is</i> you! You cut me out a pair of
boots from the skin of the unfortunate Zephyr! And we needn't speak of
the number of times you saved my life! Oh, my brave and faithful
friend, thank God that I embrace you once more! Yes, I recognize you
now; but I needn't say that you are
changed!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg
173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gad! <i>I</i> haven't been preserved in a jug of spirits of wine.
I've
<i>lived</i>, for my part!"</p>

<p>"You know my history, then?"</p>

<p>"I heard it told last night at the Minister's of Public
Instruction. He had there the savant who set you on your legs again. I
even wrote to you, on getting back home, to offer you a bunk and a
place at mess; but my letter is on the way to Fontainebleau."</p>

<p>"Thanks! You're a sound one! Ah, my poor old boy, what things have
happened since Beresina! You know all the misfortunes that have
come?"</p>

<p>"I've seen them, and that's sadder still. I was a major after
Waterloo; the Bourbons put me aside on half-pay. My friends got me
back into service again in 1822, but I had bad luck, and lazed around
in garrisons at Lille, Grenoble, and Strasburg, without getting ahead
any. My second epaulette did not reach me till 1830; then I took a
little turn in Africa. I was made brigadier-general at Isly, got home
again, and banged about from pillar to post until 1848. During that
year we had a June campaign in Paris itself. My heart still bleeds
every time I think of it, and, upon my soul, you're blest in not
having seen it. I got three balls in my body and a commission as
general of division. After all, I've no right to complain for the
campaign in Italy brought me good luck. Here I am, Marshal of France,
with a hundred thousand francs income, and Duke of Solferino in the
bargain. Yes, the Emperor has put a handle to
my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg
174]</a></span> name. The fact is, that short 'Leblanc' was a little
too short."</p>

<p>"Thunderation!" cried Fougas, "that's splendid! I swear, Leblanc,
that I'm not jealous of your good fortune! It's seldom enough that one
soldier rejoices over the promotion of another; but indeed, from the
bottom of my heart, I assure you that I do now. It's all the better,
since you deserved your honors, and the blind goddess must have had a
glimpse of your heart and talents, over the bandage that covers her
eyes!"</p>

<p>"You're very kind! But let's talk about yourself now: where were
you going when I met you?"</p>

<p>"To see the Emperor."</p>

<p>"So was I; but where the devil were you looking for him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; somebody was showing me the way."</p>

<p>"But he is at the Tuilleries!"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Yes! There's something under all this; tell me about it."</p>

<p>Fougas did not wait to be urged. The Marshal soon understood from
what sort of danger he had extricated his friend.</p>

<p>"The <i>concierge</i> is mistaken," said he; "the Emperor is at the
Palace; and, as we've reached there now, come with me; perhaps I can
present you after my audience."</p>

<p>"The very thing! Leblanc, my heart beats
at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg
175]</a></span> the idea of seeing this young man. Is he a good one?
Can he be counted upon? Is he anything like the other?"</p>

<p>"You can see for yourself. Wait here."</p>

<p>The friendship of these two men dated from the winter of 1812.
During the retreat of the French army, chance flung the lieutenant of
artillery and the colonel of the 23d together. One was eighteen years
old, the other not quite twenty-four. The distance between their ranks
was easily bridged over by common danger. All men are equal before
hunger, cold, and fatigue. One morning, Leblanc, at the head of ten
men, rescued Fougas from the hands of the Cossacks; then Fougas sabred
a half dozen stragglers who were trying to steal Leblanc's cloak.
Eight days later, Leblanc pulled his friend out of a hut which the
peasants had set on fire; and Fougas, in turn, fished Leblanc out of
the Beresina. The list of their dangers and their mutual services is
too long for me to give entire. To finish off, the Colonel, at
Koenigsberg, passed three weeks at the bedside of the lieutenant, who
was attacked with fever and ague. There is no doubt that this tender
care saved his life. This reciprocal devotion had formed between them
bonds so strong that a separation of forty-six years could not break
them.</p>

<p>Fougas, alone in a great saloon, was buried in the recollections of
that good old time, when an usher asked him to remove his gloves, and
go into the cabinet of the
Emperor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg
176]</a></span></p>

<p>Respect for the powers that be, which is the very foundation of my
character, does not permit me to bring august personages upon the
scene. But Fougas' correspondence belongs to contemporaneous history,
and here is the letter which he wrote to Clementine on returning to
his hotel:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Paris</span> (what am I
saying?)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Heaven</span>, <i>Aug.</i> 21,
1859.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My sweet Angel</span>: I am intoxicated with
joy, gratitude, and admiration. I have seen him, I have spoken to him;
he gave me his hand, he made me be seated. He is a great prince; he
will be the master of the world. He gave me the medal of St. Helena,
and the Cross of an Officer. Little Leblanc, an old friend and a true
heart, conducted me into his presence; he is Marshal of France, too,
and a Duke of the new empire! As for promotion, there's no more need
of speculation on that head. A prisoner of war in Prussia and in a
triple coffin, I return with my rank; so says the military law. But in
less than three months I shall be a brigadier-general&mdash;that's
certain; he deigned to promise it to me himself. What a man! A god on
earth! No more conceited than he of Wagram and Moscow, and, like him,
the father of the soldier. He wanted to give me money from his private
purse to replace my equipments. I answered, 'No, sire; I have a claim
to recover at Dantzic; if it is paid, I shall be rich; if the debt is
denied, my pay will suffice for me.' Thereupon (O Beneficence of
Princes, thou art not, then, but an empty name!) he smiled slightly,
and said, twisting his moustache, 'You remained in Prussia from 1813
to 1859?'&mdash;'Yes, sire.'&mdash;'Prisoner of war under exceptional
conditions?'&mdash;'Yes, sire.'&mdash;'The treaties of 1814 and 1815
stipulated for the release of prisoners?'&mdash;'Yes,
sire.'&mdash;'They have been violated, then, in your
case?'&mdash;'Yes, sire.'&mdash;'Well, then, Prussia owes you an
indemnity. I will see that it is recovered by diplomatic
proceedings.'&mdash;'Yes sire. What goodness!' Now, there's an idea
which would never have occurred to me! To
squeeze<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg
177]</a></span> money out of Prussia&mdash;Prussia, who showed herself
so greedy for our treasures in 1814 and 1815!
<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i> My well-beloved Clementine! Oh, may
our glorious and magnanimous sovereign live forever!
<i>Vivent l'Imperatrice et le Prince Imperial!</i> I saw
them! The Emperor presented me to his family! The Prince
is an admirable little soldier! He condescended to beat
the drum on my new hat. I wept with emotion. Her Majesty
the Empress said, with an angelic smile, that she had
heard my misfortunes spoken of. 'Oh, Madame!' I replied,
'such a moment as this compensates them a hundred
fold.'&mdash;'You must come and dance at the Tuilleries next
winter.'&mdash;'Alas, Madame, I have never danced but to the
music of cannon; but I shall spare no effort to please
you! I will study the art of Vestris."&mdash;'<i>I</i>'ve managed
to learn the quadrille very nicely,' joined in Leblanc.</p>

<p>"The Emperor deigned to express his happiness at getting back an
officer like me, who had yesterday, so to speak, taken part in the
finest campaigns of the century, and retained all the traditions of
the great war. This encouraged me. I no longer feared to remind him of
the famous principle of the good old time&mdash;to treat for peace
only in capitals! 'Take care!' said he; 'it was on the strength of
that principle that the allied armies twice came to settle the basis
of peace at Paris.'&mdash;'They'll not come here again,' cried I,
'without passing over my body!' I dwelt upon the troubles apt to come
from too much intimacy with England. I expressed a hope of at once
proceeding to the conquest of the world. First, to get back our
frontiers for ourselves; next, the natural frontiers of Europe: for
Europe is but the suburb of France, and cannot he annexed too soon.
The Emperor shook his head as if he was not of my opinion. Does he
entertain peaceful designs? I do not wish to dwell upon this idea; it
would kill me!</p>

<p>"He asked me what impressions I had formed regarding the appearance
of the changes which had been made in Paris. I answered, with the
sincerity of a lofty soul, 'Sire, the new Paris is the great work of a
great reign; but I entertain the hope that your improvements have not
yet had the finishing touch.'&mdash;'What is
left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg
178]</a></span> to be done, now, in your opinion?'&mdash;'First of
all, to remedy the course of the Seine, whose irregular curve is
positively shocking. The straight line is the shortest distance
between two points, for rivers as well as boulevards. In the second
place, to level the ground and suppress all inequalites of surface
which seem to say to the Government, 'Thou art less powerful than
Nature!' Having accomplished this preparatory work, I would trace a
circle three leagues in diameter, whose circumference, marked by an
elegant railing, should be the boundary of Paris. At the centre I
would build a palace for your Majesty and the princes of the imperial
family&mdash;a vast and splendid edifice, including in its
arrangements all the public offices&mdash;the staff offices, courts,
museums, cabinet offices, archives, police, the Institute, embassies,
prisons, bank of France, lecture-rooms, theatres, the <i>Moniteur</i>,
imperial printing office, manufactory of S&egrave;vres porcelain and
Gobelin tapestry, and commissary arrangements. At this palace,
circular in form and of magnificent architecture, should centre twelve
boulevards, a hundred and twenty yards wide, terminated by twelve
railroads, and called by the names of twelve marshals of France. Each
boulevard is built up with uniform houses, four stories high, having
in front an iron railing and a little garden three yards wide, all to
be planted with the same kind of flowers. A hundred streets, sixty
yards wide, should connect the boulevards; these streets communicate
with each other by lanes thirty-five yards wide, the whole built up
uniformly according to official plans, with railings, gardens, and
specified flowers. Householders should be prohibited from allowing any
business to be conducted in their establishments, for the aspect of
shops debases the intellect and degrades the heart. Merchants could be
permitted to establish themselves in the suburbs under the regulation
of the laws. The ground floors of all the houses to be occupied with
stables and kitchens; the first floors let to persons worth an income
of a hundred thousand francs and over; the second, to those worth from
eighty to a hundred thousand francs; the third, to those worth from
sixty to eighty thousand; the fourth, from fifty to sixty thousand. No
one with an income of less than fifty thousand francs should
be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg
179]</a></span> permitted to live in Paris. Workmen are to be lodged
ten miles outside of the boundary in workmen's barracks. We will
exempt them from taxes to make them love us; and we'll plant cannon
around them to make them fear us. That's my Paris!' The Emperor
listened to me patiently, and twisted his moustache. 'Your plan,' said
he, 'would cost a trifle.'&mdash;'Not much more than the one already
adopted,' answered I. At this remark, an unreserved hilarity, the
cause of which I am unable to explain, lit up his serious countenance.
'Don't you think,' said he, 'that your project would ruin a great many
people?'&mdash;'Eh! What difference does it make to me?' I cried,
'since it will ruin none but the rich?' He began laughing again, and
bid me farewell, saying, 'Colonel, you will have to remain colonel
only until we make you brigadier-general!' He permitted me to press
his hand a second time. I waved an adieu to brave Leblanc, who has
invited me to dine with him this evening, and I returned to my hotel
to pour my joy into your sweet soul. Oh, Clementine! hope on! You
shall be happy, and I shall be great! To-morrow morning I leave for
Dantzic. Gold is a deception, but I want you to be rich.</p>

<p>"A sweet kiss upon your pure brow!</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">V. Fougas</span>." </p></blockquote>

<p>The subscribers to <i>La Patrie</i>, who keep files of their paper,
are hereby requested to hunt up the number for the 23d of August,
1859. In it they will find two paragraphs of local intelligence, which
I have taken the liberty of copying here:</p>

<p>"His Excellency, the Marshal, the Duke of Solferino, yesterday had
the honor of presenting to his Majesty the Emperor a hero of the first
Empire, Colonel Fougas, whom an almost miraculous event, already
mentioned in a report to the Academy of Sciences, has restored to his
country."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg
180]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the first paragraph; here is the second</p>

<p>"A madman, the fourth this week, but the most dangerous of all,
presented himself yesterday at one of the entrances of the Tuilleries.
Decked out in a grotesque costume, his eyes flashing, his hat cocked
over his ear, and addressing the most respectable people with
unheard-of rudeness, he attempted to force his way past the sentry,
and thrust himself, for what purpose God only knows, into the presence
of the Sovereign. During his incoherent ejaculations, the following
words were distinguished: 'bravery, <i>Vend&ocirc;me</i> column,
fidelity, the dial-plate of time, the tablets of history.' When he was
arrested by one of the detective watch, and taken before the police
commissioner of the Tuilleries section, he was recognized as the same
individual who, the evening before, at the opera, had interrupted the
performance of Charles VI. with most unseemly cries. After the
customary medical and legal proceedings, he was ordered to be sent to
the Charenton Hospital. But opposite the <i>porte Saint-Martin</i>,
taking advantage of a lock among the vehicles, and of the Herculean
strength with which he is endowed, he wrested his hands from his
keeper, threw him down, beat him, leaped at a bound into the street,
and disappeared in the crowd. The most active search was immediately
set on foot, and we have it from the best authority that the police
are already on the track of the
fugitive."</p>

<h3>WHEREIN HERR NICHOLAS MEISER, ONE OF THE SOLID MEN OF DANTZIC,
RECEIVES AN UNWELCOME VISIT.</h3>


<p>The wisdom of mankind declares that ill-gotten gains never do any
good. I maintain that they do the robbers more good than the robbed,
and the good fortune of Herr Nicholas Meiser is an argument in support
of my proposition.</p>

<p>The nephew of the illustrious physiologist, after brewing a great
deal of beer from a very little hops, and prematurely appropriating
the legacy intended for Fougas, had amassed, by various operations, a
fortune of from eight to ten millions. "In what kind of operations?"
No one ever told me, but I know that he called all operations that
would make money, good ones. To lend small sums at a big interest, to
accumulate great stores of grain in order to relieve a scarcity after
producing it himself, to foreclose on unfortunate debtors, to fit out
a vessel or two for trade in black flesh on the African
coast&mdash;such are specimens of the speculations which the good man
did not despise. He never boasted of them, for he was modest; but he
never blushed for them, for he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182"
id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> had expanded his conscience
simultaneously with his capital. As for the rest, he was a man of
honor, in the commercial sense of the word, and capable of strangling
the whole human race rather than of letting his signature be
protested. The banks of Dantzic, Berlin, Vienna, and Paris, held him
in high esteem; his money passed through all of them.</p>

<p>He was fat, unctuous, and florid, and lived well. His wife's nose
was much too long, and her bones much too prominent, but she loved him
with all her heart, and made him little sweetmeats. A perfect
congeniality of sentiment united this charming couple. They talked
with each other with open hearts, and never thought of keeping back
any of their evil thoughts. Every year, at Saint Martin's day, when
rents became due, they turned out of doors the families of five or six
workmen who could not pay for their terms; but they dined none the
worse after it, and their good-night kiss was none the less sweet.</p>

<p>The husband was sixty-six years old, the wife sixty-four. Their
physiognomies were such as inspire benevolence and command respect. To
complete their outward resemblance to the patriarchs, nothing was
needed but children and grandchildren. Nature had given them one
son&mdash;an only one, because they had not solicited Nature for more.
They would have thought it criminal improvidence to divide their
fortune among several. Unhappily, this only child, the
heir-presumptive to so many millions, died at the University of
Heidelberg from eating too many
sau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg
183]</a></span>sages. He set out, when he was twenty, for that
Valhalla of German students, where they eat infinite sausages, and
drink inexhaustible beer; where they sing songs of eight hundred
million verses, and gash the tips of each other's noses with huge
swords. Envious Death snatched him from his parents when they were no
longer of an age to improvise a successor. The unfortunate old
millionnaires tenderly collected his effects, to sell them. During
this operation, so trying to their souls (for there was a great deal
of brand-new linen that could not be found), Nicholas Meiser said to
his wife, "My heart bleeds at the idea that our buildings and dollars,
our goods above ground and under, should go to strangers. Parents
ought always to have an extra son, just as they have a vice-umpire in
the Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>But Time, who is a great teacher in Germany and several other
countries, led them to see that there is consolation for all things
except the loss of money. Five years afterwards, Frau Meiser said to
her husband, with a tender and philosophic, smile: "Who can fathom the
decrees of Providence? Perhaps your son would have brought us to a
crust. Look at Theobald Scheffler, his old comrade. He wasted twenty
thousand francs at Paris on a woman who kicked up her legs in the
middle of a quadrille. We ourselves spent more than two thousand
thalers a year for our wicked scapegrace. His death is a great saving,
and therefore a good thing!"</p>

<p>As long as the three coffins of Fougas were
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg
184]</a></span> the house, the good dame scolded at the visions and
restlessness of her husband. "What in the name of sense are you
thinking about? You've been kicking me all night again. Let's throw
this ragamuffin of a Frenchman into the fire; then he'll no longer
disturb the repose of a peaceable family. We can sell the leaden box;
it must weigh at least two hundred pounds. The white silk will make me
a good lining for a dress; and the wool in the stuffing, will easily
make us a mattress." But a tinge of superstition prevented Meiser from
following his wife's advice; he preferred to rid himself of the
Colonel by selling him.</p>

<p>The house of this worthy couple was the handsomest and most
substantial on the street of Public Wells, in the aristocratic part of
the city. Strong railings, in iron open work, decorated all the
windows magnificently, and the door was sheathed in iron, like a
knight of the olden time. A system of little mirrors, ingeniously
arranged in the entrance, enabled a visitor to be seen before he had
even knocked. A single servant, a regular horse for work and camel for
temperance, ministered under this roof blessed by the gods.</p>

<p>The old servant slept away from the house, both because he
preferred to and because while he did so he could not be tempted to
wring the venerable necks of his employers. A few books on Commerce
and Religion constituted the library of the two old people. They never
cared to have a garden at the back
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg
185]</a></span> their house, because the shrubbery might conceal
thieves. They fastened their door with bolts every evening at eight
o'clock, and never went out without being obliged to, for fear of
meeting dangerous people.</p>

<p>And nevertheless, on the 29th of April, 1859, at eleven o'clock in
the morning, Nicholas Meiser was far away from his beloved home.
Gracious! how very far away for him&mdash;this honest burgher of
Dantzic! He was traversing, with heavy tread, the promenade in Berlin,
which bears the name of one of Alphonse Karrs' romances: <i>Sous les
tilleuls.</i> In German:
<i>Unter den Linden.</i></p>

<p>What mighty agency had thrown out of his bon-bon box, this big red
bon-bon on two legs? The same that led Alexander to Babylon, Scipio to
Carthage, Godfrey de Bouillon to Jerusalem, and Napoleon to
Moscow&mdash;Ambition! Meiser did not expect to be presented with the
keys of the city on a cushion of red velvet, but he knew a great lord,
a clerk in a government office, and a chambermaid who were working to
get a patent of nobility for him. To call himself Von Meiser instead
of plain Meiser! What a glorious dream!</p>

<p>This good man had in his character that compound of meanness and
vanity which places lacqueys so far apart from the rest of mankind.
Full of respect for power, and admiration for conventional greatness,
he never pronounced the name of king, prince, or even baron, without
emphasis and unction. He mouthed every aristocratic syllable, and the
single<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg
186]</a></span> word "Monseigneur" seemed to him like a mouthful of
well-spiced soup. Examples of this disposition are not rare in
Germany, and are even occasionally found elsewhere. If they could be
transported to a country where all men are equal, homesickness for
boot-licking would kill them.</p>

<p>The claims brought to bear in favor of Nicholas Meiser, were not of
the kind which at once spring the balance, but of the kind which make
it turn little by little. Nephew of an illustrious man of science,
powerfully rich, a man of sound judgment, a subscriber to the <i>New
Gazette of the Cross</i>, full of hatred for the opposition, author of
a toast against the influence of demagogues, once a member of the City
Council, once an umpire in the Chamber of Commerce, once a corporal in
the militia, and an open enemy of Poland and all nations but the
strong ones. His most brilliant action dated back ten years. He had
denounced, by an anonymous letter, a member of the French Parliament
who had taken refuge in Dantzic. While Meiser was walking under the
lindens, his cause was progressing swimmingly. He had received that
sweet assurance from the very lips of its promoters. And so he tripped
lightly toward the depot of the North-Eastern Railroad, without any
other baggage than a revolver in his pocket. His black leather trunk
had gone before; and was waiting for him at the station. On the way,
he was glancing into the shop windows, when he stopped short before a
stationer's, and rubbed his eyes&mdash;a sovereign
remedy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg
187]</a></span> people say, for impaired vision. Between the portraits
of Mme. Sand and M. M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, the two greatest writers of
France, he had noticed, examined, recognized a well-known
countenance.</p>

<p>"Surely," said he, "I've seen that man before, but he was paler.
Can our old lodger have come to life? Impossible! I burned up my
uncle's directions, so the world has lost&mdash;thanks to me&mdash;the
secret of resuscitating people. Nevertheless, the resemblance is
striking. Is it a portrait of Colonel Fougas, taken from life in 1813?
No; for photography was not then invented. But possibly it's a
photograph copied from an engraving? Here are Louis XVI. and Marie
Antoinette reproduced in the same way: that doesn't prove that
Robespierre had them resuscitated. Anyhow, I've had an unfortunate
encounter."</p>

<p>He took a step toward the door of the shop to reassure himself, but
a peculiar reluctance held him back. People might wonder at him, ask
him questions, try to learn the reason of his trouble. He resumed his
walk at a brisk pace, trying to reassure himself.</p>

<p>"Bah! It's an hallucination&mdash;the result of dwelling too much
on one idea. Moreover, the portrait was dressed in the style of 1813;
that settles the question."</p>

<p>He reached the station, had his black leather trunk checked, and
flung himself down at full length in a first-class compartment. First
he smoked his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188"
id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> porcelain pipe, but his two
neighbors being asleep, he soon followed their example, and began
snoring. Now this big man's snores had something awe-inspiring about
them; you could have fancied yourself listening to the trumpets of the
judgment day. What shade visited him in this hour of sleep, no other
soul has ever known; for he kept his dreams to himself, as he did
everything that was his.</p>

<p>But between two stations, while the train was running at full
speed, he distinctly felt two powerful hands pulling at his
feet&mdash;a sensation, alas! too well known, and one which called up
the ugliest recollections of his life. He opened his eyes in terror,
and saw the man of the photograph, in the costume of the photograph.
His hair stood on end, his eyes grew as big as saucers, he uttered a
loud cry, and flung himself headlong between the seats among the legs
of his neighbors.</p>

<p>A few vigorous kicks brought him to himself. He got up as well as
he could, and looked about him. No one was there but the two gentlemen
opposite, who were mechanically lanching their last kicks into the
empty space, and rubbing their eyes with their arms. He succeeded in
awakening them, and asked them about the visitation he had had; but
the gentlemen declared they had seen nothing.</p>

<p>Meiser sadly returned to his own thoughts; he noticed that the
visions appeared terribly real. This idea prevented his going to sleep
again.</p>

<p>"If this goes on much longer," thought he,
"the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg
189]</a></span> Colonel's ghost will break my nose with a blow of his
fist, or give me a pair of black eyes!"</p>

<p>A little later, it occurred to him that he had breakfasted very
hastily that morning, and he reflected that the nightmare had perhaps
been brought about by such dieting.</p>

<p>He got off at the next five-minute stopping-place and called for
soup. Some very hot vermicelli was brought him, and he blew into his
bowl like a dolphin into the Bosphorus.</p>

<p>A man passed before him, without jostling him, without saying
anything to him, without even seeing him. And nevertheless, the bowl
dropped from the hands of the rich Nicholas Meiser, the vermicelli
poured over his waistcoat and shirt-bosom, where it formed an elegant
fretwork suggestive of the architecture of the <i>porte Saint
Martin</i>. Some yellowish threads, detached from the mass, hung in
stalactites from the buttons of his coat. The vermicelli stopped on
the outside, but the soup penetrated much further. It was rather warm
for pleasure; an egg left in it ten minutes would have been boiled
hard. Fatal soup, which not only distributed itself among the pockets,
but into the most secret sinuosities of the man himself! The starting
bell rang, the waiter collected his two sous, and Meiser got into the
cars, preceded by a plaster of vermicelli, and followed by a little
thread of soup which was running down the calves of his legs.</p>

<p>And all of this, because he had seen, or
thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg
190]</a></span> he had seen, the terrible figure of Colonel Fougas
eating sandwiches.</p>

<p>Oh! how long the trip seemed! What a terrible time it appeared to
be before he could be at home, between his wife Catharine and his
servant Berbel, with all the doors safely closed! His two companions
laughed till the buttons flew; people laughed in the compartment to
the right of him, and in the compartment to the left of him. As fast
as he picked off the vermicelli, little spots of soup saucily
congealed and seemed quietly laughing. How hard it comes to a great
millionnaire to amuse people who do not possess a cent! He did not get
off again until they reached Dantzic; he did not even put his nose to
the window; he sucked solitary consolation from his porcelain pipe, on
which Leda caressed her swan and smiled not.</p>

<p>Wearisome, wearisome journey! But he did reach home nevertheless.
It was eight o'clock in the evening; the old domestic was waiting with
ropes to sling his master's trunk on his back. No more alarming
figures, no more mocking laughs! The history of the soup was fallen
into the great forgotten, like one of M. Heller's speeches. In the
baggage room, Meiser had already seized the handle of a black leather
trunk, when, at the other end, he saw the spectre of Fougas, which was
pulling in the opposite direction, and seemed inclined to dispute
possession. He bristled up, pulled stronger, and even plunged his left
hand into the pocket where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191"
id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> revolver was lying. But the luminous
glance of the Colonel fascinated him, his legs trembled, he fell, and
fancied that he saw Fougas and the black trunk rolling over each
other. When he came to, his old servant was chafing his hands, the
trunk already had the slings around it, and the Colonel had
disappeared. The domestic swore that he had not seen anybody, and that
he had himself received the trunk from the baggage agent's own
hand.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, the millionnaire was in his own house,
joyfully rubbing his face against the sharp angles of his wife. He did
not dare to tell her about his visions, for Frau Meiser was a skeptic,
in her own way. It was she who spoke to him about Fougas.</p>

<p>"A whole history has happened to me," said she. "Would you believe
that the police have written to us from Berlin, to find out whether
our uncle left us a mummy, and when, and how long we kept him, and
what we have done with him? I answered, telling the truth, and adding
that Colonel Fougas was in such a bad condition, and so damaged by
mites, that we sold him for rags. What object can the police have in
troubling themselves about our affairs?"</p>

<p>Meiser heaved a heavy sigh.</p>

<p>"Let's talk about money!" said the lady. "The president of the bank
has been to see me. The million you asked him for, for to-morrow, is
ready; it will be delivered upon your signature. It seems that they've
had a deal of trouble to get the amount in specie. If you had but
wanted drafts on Vienna or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192"
id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> Paris, you would have put them at
their ease. But at last they've done what you wanted. There's no other
news, except that Schmidt, the merchant, has killed himself. He had to
pay a note for ten thousand thalers, and didn't have half the amount
on hand. He came to ask me for the money; I offered him ten thousand
thalers, at twenty-five per cent., payable in ninety days, with a
first mortgage on all his real estate. The fool preferred to hang
himself in his shop. Everyone to his taste!"</p>

<p>"Did he hang himself very high?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that. Why?"</p>

<p>"Because one might get a piece of rope cheap, and we're greatly in
want of some, my poor Catharine! That Colonel Fougas has given me a
shiver."</p>

<p>"Some more of your notions! Come to supper, my love."</p>

<p>"Come on!"</p>

<p>The angular Baucis conducted her Philemon into a large and
beautiful dining-room, where Berbel served a repast worthy of the
gods. Soup with little balls of aniseeded bread, fish-balls with black
sauce, mutton-balls stuffed, game balls, sour-krout cooked in lard and
garnished with fried potatoes, roast hare with currant jelly, deviled
crabs, salmon from the Vistula, jellies, and fruit tarts. Six bottles
of Rhine-wine selected from the best vintages were awaiting, in their
silver caps, the master's kiss. But the lord of all these good things
was neither hungry nor thirsty. He ate by nibbles and drank by sips,
all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg
193]</a></span> time expecting a grand consummation, which he did not
have to expect along. A formidable rap of the knocker soon resounded
through the house.</p>

<p>Nicholas Meiser trembled. His wife tried to reassure him. "It's
nothing," said she. "The president of the bank told me that he was
coming to see you. He offers to pay us the exchange, if we'll take
paper instead of specie."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> about money, sure as Fate!" cried the good man. "Hell
itself is coming to see us!"</p>

<p>At the same instant, the servant rushed into the room, crying, "Oh,
Sir! Oh, Madame! It's the Frenchman of the three coffins! Jesus! Mary,
Mother of God!"</p>

<p>Fougas saluted them, and said, "Don't disturb yourselves, good
people, I beg of you. We've a little matter to discuss together, and
I'm ready to explain it to you in two words. You're in a hurry, so am
I; you've not had supper, neither have I!"</p>

<p>Frau Meiser, more rigid and more emaciated than a
thirteenth-century statue, opened wide her toothless mouth. Terror
paralyzed her. The man, better prepared for the visit of the phantom,
cocked his revolver under the table and took aim at the Colonel,
crying "<i>Vade retro, Satanas!</i>" The exorcism and the pistol
missed fire together.</p>

<p>Meiser was not at all discouraged: he snapped the six barrels one
after the other at the demon, who stood watching him do it. Not one
went off.</p>

<p>"What devilish game is that you're
playing?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg
194]</a></span> said the Colonel, seating himself astride a chair.
"People are not in the habit of receiving an honest man's visit with
that ceremony!"</p>

<p>Meiser flung down his revolver, and grovelled like a beast at
Fougas' feet. His wife, who was not one whit more tranquil, followed
him. They joined hands, and the fat man exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Spirit! I confess my misdeeds, and I am ready to make reparation
for them. I have sinned against you; I have violated my uncle's
commands. What do you wish? What do you command? A tomb? A magnificent
monument? Prayers? Endless prayers?"</p>

<p>"Idiot!" said Fougas, spurning him with his foot; "I am no spirit,
and I want nothing but the money you've robbed me of!"</p>

<p>Meiser kept rolling on the floor; but his scrawny wife was already
on her feet, her fists on her hips, and facing Fougas.</p>

<p>"Money!" cried she, "But we don't owe you any! Have you any
documents? Just show us our signature! Where would one be, Just God!
if we had to give money to all the adventurers who present themselves?
And in the first place, by what right did you thrust yourself into our
dwelling, if you're not a spirit? Ah! you're a man just the same as
other people! Ha! ha! So you're not a ghost! Very well, sir; there are
judges in Berlin; there are some in the country, too, and we'll soon
see whether you're going to finger our money! Get up there, you
great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg
195]</a></span> booby; it's only a man! And do you, Mister Ghost, get
out of here! Off with you!"</p>

<p>The Colonel did not budge more than a rock.</p>

<p>"The devil's in women's tongues! Sit down, old lady, and take your
hands away from my eyes&mdash;they bother me. And as for you,
swell-head, get on to your chair, and listen to me. There will be time
enough to go to law if we can't come to an understanding. But stamped
paper stinks in my nostrils; and therefore I'd rather settle
peaceably."</p>

<p>Herr and Frau Meiser repressed their first emotion. They distrusted
magistrates, as do all people without clean consciences. If the
Colonel was a poor devil who could be put off with a few thalers, it
would be better to avoid legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Fougas stated the case to them with entire military bluntness. He
proved the existence of his right, said that he had had his identity
substantiated at Fontainebleau, Paris, and Berlin; cited from memory
two or three passages of the will, and finished by declaring that the
Prussian Government, in conjunction with that of France, would support
his just claims if necessary.</p>

<p>"You understand clearly," said he, taking Meiser by the button of
his coat, "that I am no fox, depending on cunning. If you had a wrist
vigorous enough to swing a good sabre, we'd take the field against
each other, and I'd play you for the amount, first two cuts out of
three, as surely as that's soup before you!"</p>

<p>"Fortunately, monsieur," said Meiser, "my
age<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg
196]</a></span> shields me from all brutality. You would not wish to
trample under foot the corpse of an old man!"</p>

<p>"Venerable scoundrel! But you would have killed me like a dog, if
your pistol had not missed fire!"</p>

<p>"It was not loaded, Monsieur Colonel! It was not&mdash;&mdash;
anywhere near loaded! But I am an accommodating man, and we can come
to terms very easily. I don't owe you anything, and, moreover, there's
prescription; but after all&mdash;&mdash; how much do you want?"</p>

<p>"He has had his say: now it's my turn!"</p>

<p>The old rascal's mate softened the tone of her voice. Imagine to
yourself a saw licking a tree before biting in.</p>

<p>"Listen, Claus, my dear&mdash;listen to what Monsieur Colonel
Fougas has to say. You'll see that he is reasonable! It's not in him
to think of ruining poor people like us. Oh, Heavens! he is not
capable of it. He has such a noble heart! Such a disinterested man! An
officer worthy of the great Napoleon (God receive his soul!)."</p>

<p>"That's enough, old lady!" said Fougas, with a curt gesture which
cut the speech off in the middle. "I had an estimate made at Berlin of
what is due me&mdash;principal and interest."</p>

<p>"Interest!" cried Meiser. "But in what country, in what latitude,
do people pay interest on money? Perhaps it may sometimes happen in
business, but between friends&mdash;never, no never, my good Monsieur
Colonel! What would my good
uncle,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg
197]</a></span> who is now gazing upon us from heaven, say, if he knew
that you were claiming interest on his bequest?"</p>

<p>"Now shut up, Nickle!" interrupted his wife. "Monsieur Colonel is
just about telling you, himself, that he did not intend to be
understood as speaking of the interest."</p>

<p>"Why in the name of great guns don't you both shut up, you
confounded magpies? Here I am dying of hunger, and I didn't bring my
nightcap to go to bed here, either!&mdash;-- Now here's the upshot of
the matter: You owe me a great deal; but it's not an even
sum&mdash;there are fractions in it, and I go in for clean
transactions. Moreover, my tastes are modest. I've enough for my wife
and myself; nothing more is needed than to provide for my son!"</p>

<p>"Very well," cried Meiser; "I'll charge myself with the education
of the little fellow!"</p>

<p>"Now, during the dozen days since I again became a citizen of the
world, there is one word that I've heard spoken everywhere. At Paris,
as well as at Berlin, people no longer speak of anything but millions;
there is no longer any talk of anything else, and everybody's mouth is
full of millions. From hearing so much said about it, I've acquired a
curiosity to know what it is. Go, fetch me out a million, and I'll
give you quittance!"</p>

<p>If you want to reach an approximate idea of the piercing cries
which answered him, go to the <i>Jardin des Plantes</i> at the
breakfast hour of the birds of prey, and try to pull the meat out of
their beaks. Fougas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198"
id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> stopped his ears and remained
inexorable. Prayers, arguments, misrepresentations, flatteries,
cringings, glanced off from him like rain from a zinc roof. But at ten
o'clock at night, when he had concluded that all concurrence was
impossible, he took his hat:</p>

<p>"Good evening!" said he. "It's no longer a million that I must
have, but two millions, and all over. We'll go to law. I'm going to
supper."</p>

<p>He was on the staircase, when Frau Meiser said to her husband:</p>

<p>"Call him back, and give him his million!"</p>

<p>"Are you a fool?"</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid."</p>

<p>"I can never do it!"</p>

<p>"Father in heaven! what blockheads men are! Monsieur! Monsieur
Fougas! Monsieur Colonel Fougas! Come up again, I pray you! We consent
to all that you require!"</p>

<p>"Damnation!" said he, on re&euml;ntering; "you ought to have made
up your minds sooner. But after all, let's see the money!"</p>

<p>Frau Meiser explained to him with her tenderest voice, that poor
capitalists like themselves, were not in the habit of keeping millions
under their own lock and key.</p>

<p>"But you shall lose nothing by waiting, my sweet sir! To-morrow you
shall handle the amount in nice white silver; my husband will sign you
a check on the Royal Bank of Dantzic."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;," said the unfortunate Meiser.
He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg
199]</a></span> signed, nevertheless, for he had boundless confidence
in the practical ingenuity of Catharine. The old lady begged Fougas to
sit down at the end of the table, and dictated to him a receipt for
two millions, in payment of all demands. You may depend that she did
not forgot a word of the legal formulas, and that she arranged the
affair in due form according to the Prussian code. The receipt,
written throughout in the Colonel's hand, filled three large
pages.</p>

<p>He signed the instrument with a flourish, and received in exchange
the signature of Nicholas, which he knew well.</p>

<p>"Well," said he to the old gentleman, "you're certainly not such an
Arab as they said you were at Berlin. Shake hands, old scamp! I don't
usually shake hands with any but honest people; but on an occasion
like this, one can do a little something extra."</p>

<p>"Do it double, Monsieur Fougas," said Frau Meiser, humbly. "Will
you not join us in this modest supper?"</p>

<p>"Gad! old lady, it's not a thing to be refused. My supper must be
cold at the inn of the 'Clock'; and your viands, smoking on their
chafing dishes, have already caused me more than one fit of
distraction. Besides, here are some yellow glass flutes, on which
Fougas will not be at all reluctant to play an air."</p>

<p>The respectable Catharine had an extra plate laid, and ordered
Berbel to go to bed. The Colonel folded up Father Meiser's million,
rolled it carefully among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200"
id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> a pile of bank-bills, and put the
whole into the little pocket-book which his dear Clementine had sent
him.</p>

<p>The clock struck eleven.</p>

<p>At half-past eleven Fougas began to see everything in a rosy cloud.
He praised the Rhine wine highly, and thanked the Meisers for their
hospitality. At midnight, he assured them of his highest esteem. At
quarter past twelve, he embraced them. At half-past twelve, he
delivered a eulogy on the illustrious John Meiser, his friend and
benefactor. When he learned that John Meiser had died in that house,
he poured forth a torrent of tears. At quarter to one, he assumed a
confidential tone, and spoke of his son, whom he was going to make
happy, and of the betrothed who was waiting for him. About one
o'clock, he tasted a celebrated port wine which Frau Meiser had
herself gone to bring from the cellar. About half-past one, his tongue
thickened and his eyes grew dim; he struggled some time against
drunkenness and sleepiness, announced that he was going to describe
the Russian campaign, muttered the name of the Emperor, and slid under
the table.</p>

<p>"You may believe me, if you will," said Frau Meiser to her husband,
"this is not a man who has come into our house; it's the devil!"</p>

<p>"The devil!"</p>

<p>"If not, would I have advised you to give him a million? I heard a
voice saying to me, 'If you do not obey the messenger of the Infernal
powers, you will both die this very night.' It was on account
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg
201]</a></span> that, that I called him up stairs. Ah! if we had been
doing business with a man, I would have told you to contest it in law
to our last cent."</p>

<p>"As you please! So you're still making sport of my visions?"</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Claus dear; I was a fool!"</p>

<p>"And I've concluded I was, too."</p>

<p>"Poor innocent! Perhaps you too thought this was Colonel
Fougas?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!"</p>

<p>"As if it were possible to resuscitate a man! It is a demon, I tell
you, who assumed the shape of the Colonel, to rob us of our
money!"</p>

<p>"What can demons do with money?"</p>

<p>"Build cathedrals, to be sure!"</p>

<p>"But how is the devil to be recognized when he is disguised?"</p>

<p>"First by his cloven-foot&mdash;but this one has boots on; next by
his clipped ear."</p>

<p>"Bah! And why?"</p>

<p>"Because the devil's ears are pointed, and, in order to make them
round, he has to cut them."</p>

<p>Meiser stuck his head under the table and uttered a cry of
horror.</p>

<p>"It's certainly the devil!" said he. "But how did he happen to let
himself go to sleep?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you did not know that when I came back from the cellar, I
dropped into my chamber? I put a drop of holy water into the Port;
charm against charm, and he is
fallen."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg
202]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's splendid! But what shall we do with him, now that we have
him in our power?"</p>

<p>"What is done with demons in Scripture? The Saviour throws them
into the sea."</p>

<p>"The sea is a long way from here."</p>

<p>"But, you big baby, the public wells are just by!"</p>

<p>"And what will be said to-morrow, when the body is found?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all will be found; and even the check that we signed,
will be turned into tinder."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Herr and Frau Meiser were lugging something
toward the public wells, and soon dame Catharine murmured, <i>sotto
voce</i>, the following incantation:</p>

<p>"Demon, child of hell, be thou accursed!</p>

<p>"Demon, child of hell, be thou dashed headlong down!</p>

<p>"Demon, child of hell, return to hell!"</p>

<p>A dull sound&mdash;the sound of a body falling into water,
terminated the ceremony, and the two spouses returned to their
domicil, with the satisfaction that always follows the performance of
a duty.</p>

<p>Nicholas said to himself:</p>

<p>"I didn't think she was so credulous!"</p>

<p>"I didn't think he was so simple!" thought the worthy Kettle,
wedded wife of Claus.</p>

<p>They slept the sleep of innocence. Oh, how much less soft their
pillows would have seemed, if Fougas had gone home with his
million!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg
203]</a></span></p>

<p>At ten o'clock the next morning, while they were taking their
coffee and buttered rolls, the president of the bank called in, and
said to them:</p>

<p>"I am greatly obliged to you for having accepted a draft on Paris
instead of a million in specie, and without premium, too. That young
Frenchman you sent to us is a little brusque, but very lively, and a
good fellow."</p>

<h3>THE COLONEL TRIES TO RELIEVE HIMSELF OF A MILLION WHICH INCUMBERS
HIM.</h3>


<p>Fougas had left Paris for Berlin the day after his audience. He
took three days to make the trip, because he stopped some time at
Nancy. The Marshal had given him a letter of introduction to the
Prefect of Meurthe, who received him very politely, and promised to
aid him in his investigations. Unfortunately, the house where he had
loved Clementine Pichon was no longer standing. The authorities had
demolished it in 1827, in cutting a street through. It is certain that
the commissioners had not demolished the family with the house, but a
new difficulty all at once presented itself: the name of Pichon
abounded in the city, the suburbs, and the department. Among this
multitude of Pichons, Fougas did not know which one to hug. Tired of
hunting, and eager to hasten forward on,the road to fortune, he left
this note for the commissioner of police:</p>

<p>"Search, on the registers of personal statistics and elsewhere, for
a young girl named Clementine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205"
id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> Pichon. She was eighteen years old
in 1813; her parents kept an officers' boarding-house. If she is
alive, get her address; if she is dead, look up her heirs. A father's
happiness depends upon it!"</p>

<p>On reaching Berlin, the Colonel found that his reputation had
preceded him. The note from the Minister of War had been sent to the
Prussian Government through the French legation; Leon Renault, despite
his grief, had found time to write a word to Doctor Hirtz; the papers
had begun to talk, and the scientific societies to bestir themselves.
The Prince Regent, even, had not disdained to ask information on the
subject from his physician. Germany is a queer country, where science
interests the very princes.</p>

<p>Fougas, who had read Doctor Hirtz's letter annexed to Herr Meiser's
will, thought that he owed some acknowledgments to that excellent
gentleman. He made a call upon him, and embraced him, addressing him
as the oracle of Epidaurus. The doctor at once took possession of him,
had his baggage brought from the hotel and gave him the best chamber
in his house. Up to the 29th day of the month, the Colonel was cared
for as a friend, and exhibited as a phenomenon. Seven photographers
disputed the possession of so precious a sitter. The cities of Greece
did no more for our poor old Homer. His Royal Highness, the Prince
Regent, wished to see him <i>in propri&acirc; person&acirc;</i>, and
begged Herr Hirtz to bring him to the palace. Fougas scratched his ear
a little, and inti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206"
id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>mated that a soldier ought not to
associate with the enemy, seeming to think himself still in 1813.</p>

<p>The Prince is a distinguished soldier, having commanded in person
at the famous siege of Rastadt. He took pleasure in Fougas'
conversation; the heroic simplicity of the young old-time soldier
charmed him. He paid him huge compliments and said that the Emperor of
France was very fortunate in having around him officers of so much
merit.</p>

<p>"He has not a great many," replied the Colonel. "If there were but
four or five hundred of my stamp, your Europe would have been bagged
long ago!"</p>

<p>This answer seemed more amusing than threatening, and no addition
was immediately made to the available portion of the Prussian
army.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness directly informed Fougas that his indemnity had
been fixed at two hundred and fifty thousand francs, and that he could
receive the amount at the treasury whenever he should find it
agreeable.</p>

<p>"My Lord," replied he, "it is always agreeable to pocket the money
of an enemy&mdash;&mdash; a foreigner. But wait! I am not a
censor-bearer to Plutus: give me back the Rhine and Posen, and I'll
leave you your two hundred and fifty thousand francs."</p>

<p>"Are you dreaming?" said the Prince, laughing. "The Rhine and
Posen!"</p>

<p>"The Rhine belongs to France, and the Posen to Poland, much more
legitimately than this money to me. But so it is with great lords:
they make it a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207"
id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> duty to pay little debts, and a
point of honor to ignore big ones!"</p>

<p>The Prince winced a little, and all the faces of the court gave a
sympathetic twitch. It was discovered that M. Fougas had evinced bad
taste in letting a crumb of truth fall into a big plateful of
follies.</p>

<p>But a pretty little Viennese baroness, who was at the presentation,
was much more charmed with his appearance than scandalized at his
remarks. The ladies of Vienna have made for themselves a reputation
for hospitality which they always attempt to support, even when they
are away from their native land.</p>

<p>The baroness of Marcomarcus had still another reason for getting
hold of the Colonel: for two or three years she had, as a matter of
course, been making a photographic collection of celebrated men. Her
album was peopled with generals, statesmen, philosophers, and
pianists, who had given their portraits to her, after writing on the
back: "With respects of&mdash;&mdash;" There were to be found there
several Roman prelates, and even a celebrated cardinal; but a more
direct envoy from the other world was still wanting. She wrote Fougas,
then, a note full of impatience and curiosity, inviting him to supper.
Fougas, who was going to start for Dantzic next day, took a sheet of
paper embossed with a great eagle, and set to work to excuse himself
politely. He feared&mdash;the delicate and chivalrous soul!&mdash;that
an evening of conversation and enjoyment in the society of the
loveliest women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208"
id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> of Germany might be a sort of moral
infidelity to the recollection of Clementine. He accordingly hunted up
an eligible formula of address, and wrote:</p>

<p>"Too indulgent Beauty, I&mdash;&mdash;" The muse dictated nothing
more. He was not in the mood for writing. He felt rather more in the
mood for supper. His scruples scattered like clouds driven before a
brisk North East wind; he put on the frogged surtout, and carried his
reply himself. It was the first time that he had been out to supper
since his resuscitation. He gave evidence of a good appetite, and got
moderately drunk, but not as much so as usual. The Baroness de
Marcomarcus, astonished at his high spirits and inexhaustible
vivacity, kept him as long as she could. And moreover she said to her
friends, on showing them the Colonel's portrait, "Nothing is needed
but these French officers to conquer the world!"</p>

<p>The next day he packed a black leather trunk which he had bought at
Paris, drew his money from the treasury, and set out for Dantzic. He
went to sleep in the cars because he had been out to supper the night
before. A terrible snoring awoke him. He looked around for the snorer,
and, not finding him near him, opened the door into the adjoining
compartment (for the German cars are much larger than the French), and
shook a fat gentleman, who seemed to have a whole organ playing in his
person. At one of the stations he drank a bottle of Marsala and ate a
couple of dozen sandwiches, for last
night's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg
209]</a></span> supper seemed to have hollowed out his stomach. At
Dantzic, he rescued his black trunk from the hands of an enormous
baggage-snatcher who was trying to take possession of it.</p>

<p>He went to the best hotel in the place, ordered his supper, and
hastened to Meiser's house. His friends at Berlin had given him
accounts of that charming family. He knew that he would have to deal
with the richest and most avaricious of sharpers: that was why he
assumed the cavalier tone that may have seemed strange to more than
one reader in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>Unhappily, he let himself become a little too human as soon as he
had his million in his pocket. A curiosity to investigate the long
yellow bottles all the way to the bottom, came near doing him an ugly
turn. His reason wandered, about one o'clock in the morning, if I am
to believe the account he himself gave. He said that, after saying
"good night" to the excellent people who had treated him so well, he
tumbled into a large and deep well, whose rim was hardly raised above
the level of the street, and ought at least to have had a lamp by it.
"I came to" (it is still he speaking) "in water, very fresh and of a
pleasant taste. After swimming around a minute or two, looking for a
firm place to take hold of, I seized a big rope, and climbed without
any trouble to the surface of the earth, which was not more than forty
feet off. It required nothing but wrists and a little gymnastic skill,
and was not much of a feat, anyhow. On
gett<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg
210]</a></span>ing on to the pavement, I found myself in the presence
of a sort of night watchman, who was bawling the hours through the
street, and who asked me insolently what I was doing there. I thrashed
him for his impudence, and the gentle exercise did me good, as it set
my blood well in circulation again. Before getting back to the inn, I
stopped under a street lamp, opened my pocket-book, and saw with
pleasure that my million was not wet. The leather was thick, and the
clasp firm; moreover, I had enveloped Herr Meiser's check in a
half-dozen hundred-franc bills, in a roll as fat as a monk. These
surroundings had preserved it."</p>

<p>This examination being made, he went home, went to bed, and slept
with his fists clenched. The next morning he received, on getting up,
the following memoranda, which came from the Nancy police:</p>

<p>"Clementine Pichon, aged eighteen, minor daughter of Auguste
Pichon, hotel-keeper, and Leonie Francelot, was married, in this town,
January 11, 1814, to Louis Antoine Langevin; profession not
stated.</p>

<p>"The name of Langevin is as rare in this department, as the name of
Pichon is common. With the exception of the Hon. M. Victor Langevin,
Counsellor to the Prefecture at Nancy, there is only known Langevin
(Pierre), usually called Pierrot, miller in the commune of Vergaville,
canton of Dieuze."</p>

<p>Fougas jumped nearly to the ceiling, crying,</p>

<p>"I have a son!"</p>

<p>He called the hotel-keeper, and said to
him:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg
211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Make out my bill, and send my baggage to the depot. Take my ticket
for Nancy; I shall not stop on the way. Here are two hundred francs,
with which I want you to drink to the health of my son! He is called
Victor, after me! He is counsellor of the Prefecture! I'd rather he
were a soldier; but never mind! Ah! first get somebody to show me the
way to the bank! I must go and get a million for him!"</p>

<p>As there is no direct connection between Dantzic and Nancy, he was
obliged to stop at Berlin. M. Hirtz, whom he met accidentally, told
him that the scientific societies of the city were preparing an
immense banquet in his honor; but he declined positively.</p>

<p>"It's not," said he, "that I despise an opportunity to drink in
good company, but Nature has spoken: her voice draws me on! The
sweetest intoxication to all rightly constituted hearts is that of
paternal love!"</p>

<p>To prepare, his dear child for the joy of a return so little
expected, he enclosed his million in an envelope addressed to M.
Victor Langevin, with a long letter which closed thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>"A father's blessing is more precious than all the gold
in the world!</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Victor Fougas</span>." </p></blockquote>

<p>The infidelity of Clementine Pichon touched his <i>amour-propre</i>
a little, but he soon consoled himself for
it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg
212]</a></span></p>

<p>"At least," thought he, "I'll not have to marry an old woman, when
there's a young one waiting for me at Fontainebleau. And, moreover, my
son has a name, and a very presentable name. Fougas would be a great
deal better, but Langevin is not bad."</p>

<p>He arrived, on the 2d of September, at six o'clock in the evening,
at that large and beautiful but somewhat stupid city which constitutes
the Versailles of Lorraine. His heart was beating fit to burst. To
recuperate his energies, he took a good dinner. The landlord, when
catechized at dessert, gave him the very best accounts of M. Victor
Langevin: a man still young, married for the past six years, father of
a boy and a girl, respected in the neighborhood, and prosperous in his
affairs.</p>

<p>"I was sure of it!" said Fougas.</p>

<p>He poured down a bumper of a certain kirsch-wasser from the Black
Forest, which he fancied delicious with his maccaroni.</p>

<p>The same evening, M. Langevin related to his wife how, on returning
from the club at ten o'clock, he had been brutally accosted by a
drunken man. He at first took him for a robber, and prepared to defend
himself; but the man contented himself with embracing him, and then
ran away with all his might. This singular accident threw the two
spouses into a series of conjectures, each less probable than the
preceding. But as they were both young, and had been married barely
seven years, they soon changed the
subject.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg
213]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning, Fougas, laden down like a miller's ass with
bon-bons, presented himself at M. Langevin's. In order to make himself
welcome to his two grandchildren, he had skimmed the shop of the
celebrated Leb&egrave;gue&mdash;the Boissier of Nancy. The servant who
opened the door for him asked if he were the gentleman her master
expected.</p>

<p>"Good!" said he; "my letter has come?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; yesterday morning. And your baggage?"</p>

<p>"I left it at the hotel."</p>

<p>"Monsieur will not be satisfied at that. Your room is ready, up
stairs."</p>

<p>"Thanks! thanks! thanks! Take this hundred franc note for the good
news."</p>

<p>"Oh, monsieur! it was not worth so much."</p>

<p>"But where is he? I want to see him&mdash;to embrace him&mdash;to
tell him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's dressing, monsieur; and so is madame."</p>

<p>"And the children&mdash;my dear grandchildren?"</p>

<p>"If you want to see them, they're right here, in the dining
room."</p>

<p>"If I want to! Open the door right away!"</p>

<p>He discovered that the little boy resembled him, and was overjoyed
to see him in the dress of an artillerist playing with a sabre. His
pockets were soon emptied on the floor; and the two children, at the
sight of so many good things, hung about his neck.</p>

<p>"O philosophers!" cried the Colonel, "do you dare to deny the
existence of the voice of
Nature?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg
214]</a></span></p>

<p>A pretty little lady (all the young women are pretty in Nancy) ran
in at the joyous cries of the little brood.</p>

<p>"My daughter-in-law!" cried Fougas, opening his arms.</p>

<p>The lady of the house modestly recoiled, and said, with a slight
smile:</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, sir; I am not your
daughter-in-law;<a name="FNanchor_9_9"
id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[9]</sup></a> I am Madame Langevin."</p>

<p>"What a fool I am!" thought the Colonel. "Here I was going to tell
our family secrets before these children. Mind your manners, Fougas!
You are in fine society, where the ardor of the sweetest sentiments is
hidden under the icy mask of indifference."</p>

<p>"Be seated," said Mme. Langevin. "I hope that you have had a
pleasant journey?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madame. Only steam seemed too slow for me!"</p>

<p>"I did not know that you were in such a hurry to get here."</p>

<p>"You did not, then, appreciate that I was fairly burning to be with
you?"</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it; it is a proof that Reason and Family
Affection have made themselves heard at last."</p>

<p>"Was it my fault that family ties did not speak effectually
sooner?"</p>

<p>"Well, after all, the main thing is that you have listened to them.
We will exert ourselves to prevent your finding Nancy
uninteresting."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215"
id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"How could I, since I am to live with you?"</p>

<p>"Thank you! Our house will be yours. Try to imagine yourself
entirely at home."</p>

<p>"In imagination, and affection too, madame."</p>

<p>"And you'll not think of Paris again?"</p>

<p>"Paris!&mdash;-- I don't care any more for it than I do for
doomsday!"</p>

<p>"I forewarn you that people are not in the habit of fighting duels
here."</p>

<p>"What? You know already&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We know all about it, even to the history of that famous supper
with those rather volatile ladies."</p>

<p>"How the devil did you hear of that? But that time, believe me, I
was very excusable."</p>

<p>M. Langevin here made his appearance, freshly shaven and
rubicund&mdash;a fine specimen of the sub-prefect in embryo.</p>

<p>"It's wonderful," thought Fougas, "how well all our family bear
their years! One wouldn't call that chap over thirty-five, and he's
forty-six if he's a day. He doesn't look a bit like me, by the way; he
takes after his mother!"</p>

<p>"My dear!" said Mme. Langevin, "here's a tough subject, who
promises to be wiser in future."</p>

<p>"You are welcome, young man!" said the Counsellor, offering his
hand to Fougas.</p>

<p>This reception appeared cold to our poor hero. He had been dreaming
of a shower of kisses and tears, and here his children contented
themselves with offering their
hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg
216]</a></span></p>

<p>"My chi&mdash;&mdash; monsieur," said he to Langevin, "there is one
person still needed to complete our reunion. A few mutual wrongs, and
those smoothed over by time, ought not to build an insurmountable
barrier between us. May I venture to request the favor of being
presented to your mother?"</p>

<p>M. Langevin and his wife opened their eyes in astonishment.</p>

<p>"How, monsieur?" said the husband. "Paris life must have affected
your memory. My poor mother is no more. It is now three years since we
lost her!"</p>

<p>The good Fougas burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Forgive me!" said he; "I didn't know it. Poor woman!"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you! You knew my mother?"</p>

<p>"Ingrate!"</p>

<p>"Why, you're an amusing fellow! But your parents were invited to
the funeral, were they not?"</p>

<p>"Whose parents?"</p>

<p>"Your father and mother!"</p>

<p>"Eh! What's this you're cackling to me about? My mother was dead
before yours was born!"</p>

<p>"Your mother dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly; in '89!"</p>

<p>"What! Wasn't it your mother who sent you here?"</p>

<p>"Monster! It was my fatherly heart that brought
me!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg
217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fatherly heart?&mdash;&mdash; Why, then you're not young Jamin,
who has been cutting up didoes in the capital, and has been sent to
Nancy to go through the Agricultural School?"</p>

<p>The Colonel answered with the voice of Jupiter tonans:</p>

<p>"I am Fougas!"</p>

<p>"Very well!"</p>

<p>"If Nature says nothing to you in my behalf, ungrateful son,
question the spirit of your mother!"</p>

<p>"Upon my soul, sir," cried the Counsellor, "we can play at cross
purposes a good while! Sit down there, if you please, and tell me your
business&mdash;&mdash; Marie, take away the children."</p>

<p>Fougas did not require any urging. He detailed the romance of his
life, without omitting anything, but with many delicate touches for
the filial ears of M. Langevin. The Counsellor heard him patiently,
with an appearance of perfect disinterestedness.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said he, at last, "at first I took you for a madman;
but now I remember that the newspapers have contained some scraps of
your history, and I see that you are the victim of a mistake. I am not
forty-six years old, but thirty-four. My mother's name was not
Clementine Pichon, but Marie Herval. She was not born at Nancy, but at
Vannes, and she was but seven years old in 1813. Nevertheless, I am
happy to make your acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Ah! you're not my son!" replied Fougas, angrily. "Very well! So
much the worse for you!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218"
id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> No one seems to want a father of the
name of Fougas! As for sons by the name of Langevin, one only has to
stoop to pick them up. I know where to find one who is not a
Counsellor of the Prefecture, it is true, and who does not put on a
laced coat to go to mass, but who has an honest and simple heart, and
is named Pierre, just like me! But, I beg your pardon, when one shows
gentlemen the door, one ought at least to return what belongs to
them."</p>

<p>"I don't prevent your collecting the bon-bons which my children
have scattered over the floor."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm talking about bon-bons with a vengeance! My million,
sir!"</p>

<p>"What million?"</p>

<p>"Your brother's million!&mdash;-- No! The million that belongs to
him who is not your brother&mdash;to Clementine's son, my dear and
only child, the only scion of my race, Pierre Langevin, called
Pierrot, a miller at Vergaville!"</p>

<p>"But I assure you, monsieur, that I haven't your million, or
anybody's else."</p>

<p>"You dare to deny it, scoundrel, when I sent it to you by mail,
myself!"</p>

<p>"Possibly you sent it, but I certainly have not received it!"</p>

<p>"Aha! Defend yourself!"</p>

<p>He made at his throat, and perhaps France would have lost a
Counsellor of Prefecture that day, if the servant had not come in with
two letters in her hand. Fougas recognized his own handwriting and
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg
219]</a></span> Berlin postmark, tore open the envelope, and displayed
the check.</p>

<p>"Here," said he, "is the million I intended for you, if you had
seen fit to be my son! Now it's too late for you to retract. The voice
of Nature calls me to Vergaville. Your servant, sir!"</p>

<p>On the 4th of September, Pierre Langevin, miller at Vergaville,
celebrated the marriage of Cadet Langevin, his second son. The
miller's family was numerous, respectable, and in comfortable
circumstances. First, there was the grandfather, a fine, hale old man,
who took his four meals a day, and doctored his little ailings with
the wine of Bar or Thiaucourt. The grandmother, Catharine, had been
pretty in her day, and a little frivolous; but she expiated by
absolute deafness the crime of having listened too tenderly to
gallants. M. Pierre Langevin, alias Pierrot, alias Big Peter, after
having sought his fortune in America (a custom becoming quite general
in the rural districts), had returned to the village in pretty much
the condition of the infant Saint John, and God only knows how many
jokes were perpetrated over his ill luck. The people of Lorraine are
terrible wags, and if you are not fond of personal jokes, I advise you
not to travel in their neighborhood. Big Peter, stung to the quick,
and half crazed at having run through his inheritance, borrowed money
at ten per cent., bought the mill at Vergaville, worked like a
plough-horse in heavy land, and repaid his capital and the interest.
Fortune, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg
220]</a></span> owed him some compensations, gave him <i>gratis pro
Deo</i>, a half dozen superb workers&mdash;six big boys, whom his wife
presented him with, one annually, as regularly as clock-work. Every
year, nine months, to a day, after the <i>f&ecirc;te</i> of
Vergaville, Claudine (otherwise known as Glaudine) presented one for
baptism. At last she died after the sixth, from eating four huge
pieces of <i>quiche</i> before her churching. Big Peter did not marry
again, having concluded that he had workers enough, and he continued
to add to his fortune nicely. But, as standing jokes last a long time
in villages, the miller's comrades still spoke to him about those
famous millions which he did not bring back from America, and Big
Peter grew very red under his flour, just as he used to in his earlier
days.</p>

<p>On the 4th of September, then, he married his second son to a good
big woman of Altroff, who had fat and blazing cheeks: this being a
kind of beauty much affected in the country. The wedding took place at
the mill, because the bride was orphaned of father and mother, and had
previously lived with the nuns of Molsheim.</p>

<p>A messenger came and told Pierre Langevin that a gentleman wearing
decorations had something to say to him, and Fougas appeared in all
his glory. "My good sir," said the miller, "I am far from being in a
mood to talk business, as we just took a good pull at white wine
before mass; but we are going to drink some red wine that's by no
means bad, at dinner, and if your heart prompts you, don't be
back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg
221]</a></span>ward! The table is a long one. We can talk afterwards.
You don't say no? Then that's yes."</p>

<p>"For once," thought Fougas, "I am not mistaken. This is surely the
voice of Nature! I would have liked a soldier better, but this genial
rustic, so comfortably rounded, satisfies my heart. I cannot be
indebted to him for many gratifications of my pride; but never mind! I
am sure of <i>his</i> good-will."</p>

<p>Dinner was served, and the table more heavily laden with viands
than the stomach of Gargantua. Big Peter, as proud of his big family
as of his little fortune, made the Colonel stand by as he enumerated
his children. And Fougas was joyful at learning that he had six
welcome grandchildren.</p>

<p>He was seated at the right of a little stunted old woman who was
presented to him as the grandmother of the youngsters. Heavens! how
changed Clementine appeared to him. Save the eyes which were still
lively and sparkling, there was no longer anything about her that
could be recognized. "See," thought Fougas, "what I would have been
like to-day, if the worthy John Meiser had not desiccated me!" He
smiled to himself on regarding Grandfather Langevin, the reputed
progenitor of this numerous family. "Poor old fellow," murmured
Fougas, "you little think what you owe to me!"</p>

<p>They dine boisterously at village weddings. This is an abuse which,
I sincerely hope, Civilization will never reform. Under cover of the
noise, Fougas entered into conversation, or thought he did,
with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg
222]</a></span> his left-hand neighbor. "Clementine!" he said to her.
She raised her eyes, and her nose too, and responded:</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>"My heart has not deceived me, then?&mdash;you are indeed my
Clementine!"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>"And you have recognized me, noble and excellent woman!"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>"But how did you conceal your emotion so well?&mdash;&mdash; How
strong women are!&mdash;-- I fall from the skies into the midst of
your peaceful existence, and you see me without moving a muscle!"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Have you forgiven me for a seeming injury for which Destiny alone
is responsible?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Thanks! A thousand thanks!&mdash;-- What a charming family you
have about you! This good Pierre, who almost opened his arms on seeing
me approach, is my son, is he not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Rejoice! He shall be rich! He already has happiness; I bring him
fortune. His portion shall be a million. Oh, Clementine! what a
commotion there will be in this simple assembly, when I raise my voice
and say to my son: 'Here! this million is for you!' Is it a good time
now? Shall I speak? Shall I tell
all?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg
223]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>Fougas immediately arose, and requested silence. The people thought
he was going to sing a song, and all kept quiet.</p>

<p>"Pierre Langevin," said he with emphasis, "I have come back from
the other world, and brought you a million."</p>

<p>If Big Peter did not want to get angry, he at least got red, and
the joke seemed to him in bad taste. But when Fougas announced that he
had loved the grandmother in her youth, grandfather Langevin no longer
hesitated to fling a bottle at his head. The Colonel's son, his
splendid grandchildren, and even the bride all jumped up in high
dudgeon and there was a very pretty scrimmage indeed.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life, Fougas did not get the upper hand.
He was afraid that he might injure some of his family. Paternal
affection robbed him of three quarters of his power.</p>

<p>But having learned during the clamor that Clementine was called
Catharine, and that Pierre Langevin was born in 1810, he resumed the
offensive, blacked three eyes, broke an arm, mashed two noses, knocked
in four dozen teeth, and regained his carriage with all the honors of
war.</p>

<p>"Devil take the children!" said he, while riding in a post-chaise
toward the Avricourt station. "If I have a son, I wish he may find
me!"</p>

<h3>HE SEEKS AND BESTOWS THE HAND OF CLEMENTINE.</h3>


<p>On the fifth of September, at ten o'clock in the morning, Leon
Renault, emaciated, dejected and scarcely recognizable, was at the
feet of Clementine Sambucco in her aunt's parlor. There were flowers
on the mantel and flowers in all the vases. Two great burglar sunbeams
broke through the open windows. A million of little bluish atoms were
playing in the light, crossing each other and getting fantastically
mixed up, like the ideas in a volume of M. Alfred Houssaye. In the
garden, the apples were falling, the peaches were ripe, the hornets
were ploughing broad, deep furrows in the <i>duchesse</i> pears; the
trumpet-flowers and clematis-vines were in blossom, and to crown all,
a great mass of heliotropes, trained over the left window, was
flourishing in all its beauty. The sun had given all the grapes in the
arbor a tint of golden bronze; and the great Yucca on the lawn, shaken
by the wind like a Chinese hat, noiselessly clashed its silver bells.
But the son of M. Renault was more pale and haggard than
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg
225]</a></span> white lilac sprays, more blighted than the leaves on
the old cherry-tree; his heart was without joy and without hope, like
the currant bushes without leaves and without fruit!</p>

<p>To be exiled from his native land, to have lived three years in an
inhospitable climate, to have passed so many days in deep mines, so
many nights over an earthenware stove in the midst of an infinity of
bugs and a multiplicity of serfs, and to see himself set aside for a
twenty-five-louis Colonel whom he himself had brought to life by
soaking him in water!</p>

<p>All men are subject to disappointments, but surely never had one
encountered a misfortune so unforeseen and so extraordinary. Leon knew
that Earth is not a valley flowing with chocolate and soup <i>&agrave;
la reine</i>. He knew the list of the renowned unfortunates beginning
with Abel slain in the garden of Paradise, and ending with Rubens
assassinated in the gallery of the Louvre at Paris. But history, which
seldom instructs us, never consoles us. The poor engineer in vain
repeated to himself that a thousand others had been supplanted on the
day before marriage, and a hundred thousand on the day after.
Melancholy was stronger than Reason, and three or four soft locks were
beginning to whiten about his temples.</p>

<p>"Clementine!" said he, "I am the most miserable of men. In refusing
me the hand which you have promised, you condemn me to agony a hundred
times worse than death. Alas! What would you have me become without
you? I must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg
226]</a></span> live alone, for I love you too well to marry another.
For four long years, all my affections, all my thoughts have been
centred upon you; I have become accustomed to regard other women as
inferior beings, unworthy of attracting the interest of a man! I will
not speak to you of the efforts I have made to deserve you; they
brought their reward in themselves, and I was already too happy in
working and suffering for you. But see the misery in which your
desertion has left me! A sailor thrown upon a desert island has less
to deplore than I: I will be forced to live near you, to witness the
happiness of another, to see you pass my windows upon the arm of my
rival! Ah! death would be more endurable than this constant agony. But
I have not even the right to die! My poor old parents have already
sorrows enough. What would it be, Great God! if I were to condemn them
to bear the loss of their son?"</p>

<p>This complaint, punctuated with sighs and tears, lacerated the
heart of Clementine. The poor child wept too, for she loved Leon with
her whole soul, but she was interdicted from telling him so. More than
once, on seeing him half dying before her, she felt tempted to throw
her arms about his neck, but the recollection of Fougas paralyzed all
her tender impulses.</p>

<p>"My poor friend," said she, "you judge me very wrongfully if you
think me insensible to your sufferings. I have known you thoroughly,
Leon, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg
227]</a></span> that too since my very childhood. I know all that
there is in you of devotion, delicacy and precious and noble virtues.
Since the time when you carried me in your arms to the poor, and put a
penny in my hand to teach me to give alms, I have never heard
benevolence spoken of without involuntarily thinking of you. When you
whipped a boy twice your size for taking away my doll, I felt that
courage was noble and that a woman would be happy in being able to
lean on a brave man. All that I have ever seen you do since that time,
has only redoubled my esteem and my sympathy. Believe me that it is
neither from wickedness or ingratitude that I make you suffer now.
Alas! I no longer belong to myself, I am under external control; I am
like those automatons that move without knowing why. Yes, I feel an
impulse within me more powerful than my self control, and it is the
will of another that leads me."</p>

<p>"If I could but be sure that you will be happy! But no! This man,
before whom you immolate me, will never know the worth of a soul as
delicate as yours. He is a brute, a swash-buckler, a drunkard."</p>

<p>"I beseech you, Leon, remember that he has a right to my unreserved
respect!"</p>

<p>"Respect! For him! And why? I ask of you, in Heaven's name, what
you find respectable in the character of Mister Fougas? His age? He is
younger than I. His talents? He never shows them anywhere but at the
table. His education? It's
lovely!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg
228]</a></span> His virtues? <i>I</i> know what is to be thought of
his refinement and gratitude!"</p>

<p>"I have respected him, Leon, since I first saw him in his coffin.
It is a sentiment stronger than all else; I cannot explain it, I can
but submit to it."</p>

<p>"Very well! Respect him as much as you please! Yield to the
superstition that enchains you. See in him a miraculous being,
consecrated, rescued from the grip of Death to accomplish something
great on earth! But this itself, Oh my dear Clementine, is a barrier
between you and him! If Fougas is outside of the conditions of
humanity, if he is a phenomenon, a being apart, a hero, a demigod, a
fetich, you cannot seriously think of becoming his wife. As for me, I
am but a man like others, born to work, to suffer and to love. I love
you! Love me!"</p>

<p>"Scoundrel!" cried Fougas, opening the door.</p>

<p>Clementine uttered a cry, Leon sprung up quickly, but the Colonel
had already seized him by the most practicable part of his nankeen
suit, before he had even time to think of a single word in reply. The
engineer was lifted up, balanced like an atom in one of the sunbeams,
and flung into the very midst of the heliotropes. Poor Leon! Poor
heliotropes!</p>

<p>In less than a second, the young man was on his feet. He dusted the
earth from his knees and elbows, approached the window, and said in a
calm but resolute voice: "Mister Colonel, I sincerely regret having
brought you back to life, but possibly
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg
229]</a></span> folly of which I have been guilty is not irreparable.
I hope soon to have an opportunity to find out if it be! As for you,
Mademoiselle, I love you!"</p>

<p>The Colonel shrugged his shoulders and put himself at the young
girl's feet on the very cushion which still bore the impression left
by Leon. Mlle. Virginie Sambucco, attracted by the noise, came down
stairs like an avalanche and heard the following conversation.</p>

<p>"Idol of a great soul! Fougas returns to thee like the eagle to his
eyrie. I have long traversed the world in pursuit of rank, fortune and
family which I was burning to lay at thy feet. Fortune has obeyed me
as a slave: she knows in what school I learned the art of controlling
her. I have gone through Paris and Germany like a victorious meteor
led by its star. I have everywhere associated as an equal with the
powers of Earth, and made the trumpet of truth resound in the halls of
kings. I have put my foot on the throat of greedy Avarice, and
snatched from him a part, at least, of the treasures which he had
stolen from too-confiding Honor. One only blessing is denied me: the
son I hoped to see has escaped the lynx-eyes of paternal love. Neither
have I found the ancient object of my first affections. But what
matters it? I shall feel the want of nothing, if you fill for me the
place of all. What do we wait for now? Are you deaf to the voice of
Happiness which calls you? Let us go to the temple of the laws, then
you shall follow me to the foot of the altar; a
priest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg
230]</a></span> shall consecrate our bonds, and we will go through
life leaning on one another, I like the oak sustaining weakness, thou
like the graceful ivy ornamenting the emblem of
strength."<a name="FNanchor_10_10"
id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p>Clementine remained a few moments without answering, as if stunned
by the Colonel's vehement rhetoric. "Monsieur Fougas," she said to
him, "I have always obeyed you, I promise to obey you all my life. If
you do not wish me to marry poor Leon, I will renounce him. I love him
devotedly, nevertheless, and a single word from him arouses more
emotion in my heart than all the fine things you have said to me."</p>

<p>"Good! Very good!" cried the Aunt. "As for me, sir, although you
have never done me the honor to consult me, I will tell you my
opinion. My niece is not at all the woman to suit you. Were you richer
than M. de Rothschild and more illustrious than the Duke of Malakoff,
I would not advise Clementine to marry you."</p>

<p>"And why, chaste Minerva?"</p>

<p>"Because you would love her fifteen days, and then, at the first
sound of cannon, be off to the wars! You would abandon her, sir, just
as you did that unhappy Clementine whose misfortunes have been
recounted to us!"</p>

<p>"Zounds! Lady Aunt! I <i>do</i> advise you to bestow your pity
on <i>her</i>! Three months after Leipzic, she married a fellow named
Langevin at Nancy."</p>

<p>"What do you say?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231"
id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>"I say that she married a military commissary named Langevin."</p>

<p>"At Nancy?"</p>

<p>"At that identical town."</p>

<p>"This is strange!</p>

<p>"It's outrageous!</p>

<p>"But this woman&mdash;this young girl&mdash;her name?</p>

<p>"I've told you a hundred times: Clementine!"</p>

<p>"Clementine what?</p>

<p>"Clementine Pichon."</p>

<p>"Gracious Heavens! My keys! Where are my keys? I'm sure I put them
in my pocket! Clementine Pichon! M. Langevin! It's impossible! My
senses are forsaking me! Come, my child, bestir yourself! The
happiness of your whole life is concerned. Where <i>did</i> you poke
my keys? Ah! Here they are!"</p>

<p>Fougas bent over to Clementine's ear, and said:</p>

<p>"Is she subject to these attacks? One, would suppose that the poor
old girl had lost her head!"</p>

<p>But Virginie Sambucco had already opened a little rosewood
secretary. Her unerring glance discovered in a file of papers, a sheet
yellow with age.</p>

<p>"I've got it!" said she with a cry of joy. "Marie Clementine
Pichon, legitimate daughter of August Pichon, hotel keeper, <i>rue des
Merlettes</i>, in this town of Nancy; married June 10th, 1814, to
Joseph Langevin, military sub-commissary. Is it surely she, Monsieur?
Dare to say it isn't she!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232"
id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well! But how do you happen to have my family papers?"</p>

<p>"Poor Clementine! And you accuse her of unfaithfulness! You do not
understand then that you had been taken for dead! That she supposed
herself a widow without having been a wife; that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's all right! It's all right! I forgive her. Where is she? I
want to see her, to embrace her, to tell her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is dead, Monsieur! She died three months after she was
married,"</p>

<p>"Ah! The Devil!"</p>

<p>"In giving birth to a daughter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where is my daughter? I'd rather have had a son, but never mind!
Where is she? I want to see her, to embrace her, to tell
her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Alas! She is no more! But I can conduct you to her tomb."</p>

<p>"But how the Devil did you know her?"</p>

<p>"Because she married my brother!"</p>

<p>"Without my consent? But never mind! At least she left some
children, didn't she?"</p>

<p>"Only one."</p>

<p>"A son! He is my grandson!"</p>

<p>"A daughter."</p>

<p>"Never mind! She is my granddaughter! I'd rather have had a
grandson, but where is she? I want to see her, to embrace her, to tell
her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Embrace away, Monsieur! Her name is Clementine: after her
grandmother, and there she
is!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg
233]</a></span></p>

<p>"She! That accounts for the resemblance! But then I can't marry
her! Never mind! Clementine! Come to my arms! Embrace your
grandfather!"</p>

<p>The poor child had not been able entirely to comprehend this rapid
conversation, from which events had been falling like tiles, upon the
head of the Colonel. She had always heard M. Langevin spoken of as her
maternal grandfather, and now she seemed to hear that her mother was
the daughter of Fougas. But she knew at the first words, that it was
no longer possible for her to marry the Colonel, and that she would
soon be married to Leon Renault. It was, therefore, from an impulse of
joy and gratitude that she flung herself into the arms of the
young-old man.</p>

<p>"Ah, Monsieur!" said she, "I have always loved and respected you
like a grandfather!"</p>

<p>"And I, my poor child, have always behaved myself like an old
beast! All men are brutes, and all women are angels. You divined with
the delicate instinct of your sex, that you owed me respect, and I,
fool that I am, didn't divine anything at all! Whew! Without the
venerable Aunt there, I'd have made a pretty piece of work!"</p>

<p>"No," said the aunt." You would have found out the truth in going
over our family papers."</p>

<p>"Would that I could have seen them and nothing more! Just to think
that I went off to seek my heirs in the department of Meurthe, when I
had left my family in Fontainebleau! Imbecile! Bah! But never mind.
Clementine! You shall be rich, you
shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg
234]</a></span> marry the man you love! Where is he, the brave boy? I
want to see him, to embrace him, to tell him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Alas, Monsieur; you just threw him out of the window."</p>

<p>"I? Hold on, it <i>is</i> true. I had forgotten all about it.
Fortunately he's not hurt, and I'll go at once and make amends for my
folly. You shall get married when you want to; the two weddings shall
come off together.&mdash;But in fact, no! What am I saying? I shall
not marry now! It will all be well soon, my child, my dear
granddaughter. Mademoiselle Sambucco you're a model aunt; embrace
me!"</p>

<p>He ran to M. Renault's house, and Gothon, who saw him coming, ran
down to shut him out.</p>

<p>"Ain't you ashamed of yourself," said she, "to act this way with
them as brought you to life again? Ah! If it had to be done over
again! We wouldn't turn the house upside down again for the sake of
your fine eyes! Madame's crying, Monsieur is tearing his hair, M. Leon
has just been sending two officers to hunt you up. What have you been
at again since morning?"</p>

<p>Fougas gave her a twirl on her feet and found himself face to face
with the engineer. Leon had heard the sound of a quarrel, and on
seeing the Colonel excited, with flashing eyes, he expected some
brutal aggression and did not wait for the first blow. A struggle took
place in the passage amid the
cries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg
235]</a></span> of Gothon, M. Renault and the poor old lady, who was
screaming: "Murder!" Leon wrestled, kicked, and from time to time
launched a vigorous blow into the body of his antagonist. He had to
succumb, nevertheless; the Colonel finished by upsetting him on the
ground and holding him there. Then he kissed him on both cheeks and
said to him:</p>

<p>"Ah! You naughty boy! Now I'm pretty sure to make you listen to me!
I am Clementine's grandfather, and I give her to you in marriage, and
you can have the wedding to-morrow if you want to! Do you hear? Now
get up, and don't you punch me in the stomach any more. It would be
almost parricide!"</p>

<p>Mlle. Sambucco and Clementine arrived in the midst of the general
stupefaction. They completed the recital of Fougas, who had gotten
himself pretty badly mixed up in the genealogy. Leon's seconds
appeared in their turn. They had not found the enemy in the hotel
where he had taken up his quarters, and came to give an account of
their mission. A tableau of perfect happiness met their astonished
gaze, and Leon invited them to the wedding.</p>

<p>"My friends," said Fougas, "you shall see undeceived Nature bless
the chains of Love."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>A THUNDERBOLT FROM A CLEAR SKY.</h3>


<blockquote><p>"Mlle. Virginie Sambucco has the honor to announce to
you the marriage of Mlle. Clementine Sambucco, her niece, to M. Leon
Renault, civil engineer.</p>

<p>"M. and Mme. Renault have the honor to announce to you the marriage
of M. Leon Renault, their son, to Mlle. Clementine Sambucco;</p>

<p>"And invite you to be present at the nuptial benediction which will
be given them on the 11th of September, 1859, in the church of Saint
Maxcence, in their parish, at eleven o'clock
precisely." </p></blockquote>

<p>Fougas absolutely insisted that his name should figure on the
cards. They had all the trouble in the world to cure him of this whim.
Mme. Renault lectured him two full hours. She told him that in the
eyes of society, as well as in the eyes of the law, Clementine was the
granddaughter of M. Langevin; that, moreover, M. Langevin had acted
very liberally in legitimizing by marriage, a daughter that was not
his own; finally, that the publication of such a family secret would
be an outrage against the sanctity of the grave and would tarnish the
memory of poor Clementine Pichon. The Colonel answered with
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg
237]</a></span> warmth of a young man, and the obstinacy of an old
one:</p>

<p>"Nature has her rights; they are anterior to the conventions of
society, and a thousand times more exalted. The honor of her I called
my &AElig;gle, is dearer to me than all the treasures of the world,
and I would cleave the soul of any rash being who should attempt to
tarnish it. In yielding to the ardor of my vows, she but conformed to
the custom of a great epoch when the uncertainty of life and the
constant existence of war simplified all formalities. And in
conclusion, I do not wish that my grandchildren, yet to be born,
should be ignorant that the source of their blood is in the veins of
Fougas. Your Langevin is but an intruder who covertly slipped into my
family. A commissary! It's almost a sutler! I spurn under foot the
ashes of Langevin!"</p>

<p>His obstinacy would not yield to the arguments of Mme. Renault, but
it succumbed to the entreaties of Clementine. The young creole twisted
him around her finger with irresistible grace.</p>

<p>"My good Grandpa this, my pretty little Grandpa that; my old baby
of a Grandpa, we'll send you off to college if you're not
reasonable!"</p>

<p>She used to seat herself familiarly on Fougas' knee, and give him
little love pats on the cheeks. The Colonel would assume the gruffest
possible voice, and then his heart would overflow with tenderness, and
he would cry like a child.</p>

<p>These familiarities added nothing to the
hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg
238]</a></span>piness of Leon Renault; I even think that they slightly
tempered his joy. Yet he certainly did not doubt either the love of
his betrothed or the honor of Fougas. He was forced to admit that
between a grandfather and his granddaughter such little liberties are
natural and proper and could justly offend no one. But the situation
was so new and so unusual that he needed a little time to adapt his
feelings to it, and forget his chagrin. This grandfather, for whom he
had paid five-hundred francs, whose ear he had broken, for whom he had
bought a burial-place in the Fontainebleau cemetery: this ancestor
younger than himself, whom he had seen drunk, whom he had found
agreeable, then dangerous, then insupportable: this venerable head of
the family who had begun by demanding Clementine's hand and ended by
pitching his future grandson into the heliotropes, could not all at
once obtain unmingled respect and unreserved affection.</p>

<p>M. and Mme. Renault exhorted their son to submission and deference.
They represented M. Fougas to him as a relative who ought to be
treated with consideration.</p>

<p>"A few days of patience!" said the good mother. "He will not stay
with us long; he is a soldier and can't live out of the army any
better than a fish out of water."</p>

<p>But Leon's parents, in the bottom of their hearts, held a bitter
remembrance of so many pangs and mortifications. Fougas had been the
scourge of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239"
id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> family; the wounds which he had made
could not heal over in a day. Even Gothon bore him ill will without
confessing it. She heaved great sighs while preparing for the wedding
festivities at Mlle. Sambucco's.</p>

<p>"Ah! my poor C&eacute;lestin!" said she to her acolyte. "What a little
rascal of a grandfather we're going to have to be sure!"</p>

<p>The only person who was perfectly at ease was Fougas. He had passed
the sponge over his pranks; out of all the evil he had done, he
retained no ill will against any one. Very paternal with Clementine,
very gracious with M. and Mme. Renault, he evinced for Leon the most
frank and cordial friendship.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," said he to him, "I have studied you, I know you, and
I love you thoroughly; you deserve to be happy, and you shall be. You
shall soon see that in buying me for twenty-five napoleons, you didn't
make a bad bargain. If gratitude were banished from the universe, it
would find a last abiding place in the heart of Fougas!"</p>

<p>Three days before the marriage, M. Bonnivet informed the family
that the colonel had come into his office to ask for a conference
about the contract. He had scarcely cast his eyes on the sheet of
stamped paper, when Rrrrip! it was in pieces in the fireplace.</p>

<p>"Mister Note-scratcher," he said, "do me the honor of beginning
your
<i>chef-d'oeuvre</i> over again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> The granddaughter of Fougas does not marry
with an annuity of eight thousand francs. Nature and Friendship give her
a million. Here it is!"</p>

<p>Thereupon he took from his pocket a bank check for a million, paced
the study proudly, making his boots creak, and threw a thousand-franc
note on a clerk's desk, crying in his clearest tones:</p>

<p>"Children of the Law! Here's something to drink the health of the
Emperor and the Grand Army with!"</p>

<p>The Renault family strongly remonstrated against this liberality.
Clementine, on being told of it by her intended, had a long
discussion, in the presence of Mlle. Sambucco, with the young and
terrible grandpapa; she tried to impress upon him that he was but
twenty-four years old, that he would be getting married some day, and
that his property belonged to his future family.</p>

<p>"I do not wish," said she, "that your children should accuse me of
having robbed them. Keep your millions for my little uncles and
aunts!"</p>

<p>But for once, Fougas would not yield an inch.</p>

<p>"Are you mocking me?" he said to Clementine. "Do you think that I
will be guilty of the folly of marrying now? I do not promise you to
live like a monk of La Trappe, but at my age, a man put together like
I am can find enough to talk to around the garrisons without marrying
anybody. Mars does not borrow the torch of Hymen to light the little
aberrations of Venus! Why does man
ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg
241]</a></span> tie himself in matrimonial bonds?... For the sake of
being a father. I am one already, in the comparative degree, and in a
year, if our brave Leon does a man's part, I shall assume the
superlative. Great-grandfather! That's a lovely position for a trooper
twenty-five years old! At forty-five or fifty, I shall be
great-great-grandfather. At seventy ... the French language has no
more words to express what I shall become! But we can order one from
those babblers of the Academy! Are you afraid that I'll want for
anything in my old age? I have my pay, in the first place, and my
officer's cross. When I reach the years of Anchises or Nestor, I will
have my halt-pay. Add to all this the two hundred and fifty thousand
francs from the king of Prussia, and you shall see that I have not
only bread, but all essential fixings in the bargain, up to the close
of my career. Moreover, I have a perpetual grant, for which your
husband has paid in advance, in the Fontainebleau cemetery. With all
these possessions, and simple tastes, one is sure not to eat up one's
resources!"</p>

<p>Willing or unwilling, they had to concede all he required and
accept his million. This act of generosity made a great commotion in
the town, and the name of Fougas, already celebrated in so many ways,
acquired a new prestige. The signature of the bride was attested by
the Marshal the Duke of Solferino and the illustrious Karl Nibor, who
but a few days before had been elected to the Academy of
Sciences.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg
242]</a></span> Leon modestly retained the old friends whom he had
long since chosen, M. Audret the architect, and M. Bonnivet the
notary.</p>

<p>The Mayor was brilliant in his new scarf. The <i>cur&eacute;</i>
addressed to the young couple an affecting allocution on the
inexhaustible goodness of Providence, which still occasionally
performs a miracle for the benefit of true Christians. Fougas, who had
not discharged his religious duties since 1801, soaked two
handkerchiefs with tears.</p>

<p>"One must always part from those nearest the heart," said he on
going out of church. "But God and I are made to understand each other!
After all, what is God but a little more universal Napoleon!"</p>

<p>A Pantagruelic feast, presided over by Mlle. Virginie Sambucco in a
dress of puce-colored silk, followed immediately upon the marriage
ceremony. Twenty-four persons were present at this
family <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, among others the new colonel of the 23d and
M. du Marnet, who was almost well of his wound.</p>

<p>Fougas took up his napkin with a certain anxiety. He hoped that the
Marshal had brought his brevet as brigadier general. His expressive
countenance manifested lively disappointment at the empty plate.</p>

<p>The Duke of Solferino, who had been seated at the place of honor,
noticed this physiognomical display, and said aloud:</p>

<p>"Don't be impatient, my old comrade! I know what you miss; it was
not my fault that
the <i>f&ecirc;te</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243"
id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> was not complete. The minister of
war was out when I dropped in on my way here. I was told however, at
the department, that your affair was kept in suspense by a technical
question, but that you would receive a letter from the office within
twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"Devil take the documents!" cried Fougas. "They've got them all,
from my birth-certificate, down to the copy of my brevet colonel's
commission. You'll find out that they want a certificate of
vaccination or some such six-penny shinplaster!"</p>

<p>"Oh! Patience, young man! You've time enough to wait. It's not such
a case as mine: without the Italian campaign, which gave me a chance
to snatch the baton, they would have slit my ear like a condemned
horse, under the empty pretext that I was sixty-five years old. You're
not yet twenty-five, and you're on the point of becoming a brigadier:
the Emperor promised it to you before me. In four or five years from
now, you'll have the gold stars, unless some bad luck interferes.
After which you'll need nothing but the command of an army and a
successful campaign to make you Marshal of France and Senator, which
may nothing prevent!"</p>

<p>"Yes," responded Fougas; "I'll reach it. Not only because I am the
youngest of all the officers of my grade, and because I have been in
the mightiest of wars and followed the lessons of the master of
Bellona's fields, but above all because Destiny
has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg
244]</a></span> marked me with her sign. Why did the bullets spare me
in more than twenty battles? Why have I sped over oceans of steel and
fire without my skin receiving a scratch? It is because I have a star,
as <i>He</i> had. His was the grander, it is true, but it went out at
St. Helena, while mine is burning in Heaven still! If Doctor Nibor
resuscitated me with a few drops of warm water, it was because my
destiny was not yet accomplished. If the will of the French people has
re-established the imperial throne, it was to furnish me a series of
opportunities for my valor, during the conquest of Europe which we are
about to recommence! <i>Vive l'Empereur</i>, and me too! I shall be
duke or prince in less than ten years, and ... why not? One might try
to be at roll-call on the day when crowns are distributed! In that
case, I will adopt Clementine's oldest son: we will call him Pierre
Victor II., and he shall succeed me on the throne just as Louis XV.
succeeded his grandfather Louis XIV.!"</p>

<p>As he was finishing this wonderful speech, a <i>gendarme</i>
entered the dining room, asked for Colonel Fougas, and handed him a
letter from the Minister of War.</p>

<p>"Gad!" cried the Marshal, "it would be pleasant to have your
promotion arrive at the end of such a discourse. For once, we would
prostrate ourselves before your star! The Magi kings would be nowhere
compared with us."</p>

<p>"Read it yourself," said he to the Marshal,
hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg
245]</a></span>ing out to him the great sheet of paper. "But no! I
have always looked Death in the face; I will not turn my eyes away
from this paper thunder if it is killing me.</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Colonel</span>:</p>

<p>"In preparing the Imperial decree which elevated you to the rank of
brigadier general, I found myself in the presence of an insurmountable
obstacle: viz., your certificate of birth. It appears from that
document that you were born in 1789, and that you have already passed
your seventieth year. Now, the limit of age being fixed at sixty years
for colonels, sixty-two for brigadier generals and sixty-five for
generals of division, I find myself under the absolute necessity of
placing you upon the retired list with the rank of colonel. I know,
Monsieur, how little this measure is justified by your apparent age,
and I sincerely regret that France should be deprived of the services
of a man of your capacity and merit. Moreover, it is certain that an
exception in your favor would arouse no dissatisfaction in the army
and would meet with nothing but sympathetic approval. But the law is
express, and the Emperor himself cannot violate or elude it. The
impossibility resulting from it is so absolute that if, in your ardor
to serve the country, you were willing to lay aside your epaulettes
for the sake of beginning upon a new career, your enlistment could not
be received in a single regiment of the army. It is
fortunate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg
246]</a></span> Monsieur, that the Emperor's government has been able
to furnish you the means of subsistence in obtaining from His Royal
Highness the Regent of Prussia the indemnity which was due you; for
there is not even an office in the civil administration in which, even
by special favor, a man seventy years old could be placed. You will
very justly object that the laws and regulations now in force date
from a period when experiments on the revivification of men had not
yet met with favorable results. But the law is made for the mass of
mankind, and cannot take any account of exceptions. Undoubtedly
attention would be directed to its amendment if cases of resuscitation
were to present themselves in sufficient number.</p>

<p>"Accept, &amp;c." </p></blockquote>

<p>A gloomy silence succeeded the reading. The <i>Mene mene tekel
upharsin</i> of the oriental legends could not have more completely
produced the effect of thunderbolts. The <i>gendarme</i> was still
there, standing in the position of the soldier without arms, awaiting
Fougas' receipt. The Colonel called for pen and ink, signed the paper,
gave the <i>gendarme</i> drink-money, and said to him with
ill-suppressed emotion:</p>

<p>"You are happy, you are! No one prevents you from serving the
country. Well," added he, turning toward the Marshal, "what do you say
to that?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg
247]</a></span></p>

<p>"What would you have me say, my poor old boy? It breaks me all up.
There's no use in arguing against the law; it's express. The stupid
thing on our parts was not to think of it sooner. But who the Devil
would have thought of the retired list in the presence of such a
fellow as you are?"</p>

<p>The two colonels avowed that such an objection would never have
entered their heads; now that it had been suggested, however, they
could not see what to rebut it with. Neither of them would have been
able to enlist Fougas as a private soldier, despite his ability, his
physical strength and his appearance of being twenty-four years
old.</p>

<p>"If some one would only kill me!" cried Fougas. "I can't set myself
to weighing sugar or planting cabbages. It was in the career of arms
that I took my first steps; I must continue in it or die. What can I
do? What can I become? Take service in some foreign army? Never! The
fate of Moreau is still before my eyes.... Oh Fortune! What have I
done to thee that I should be dashed so low, when thou wast preparing
to raise me so high?"</p>

<p>Clementine tried to console him with soothing words.</p>

<p>"You shall live near us," said she. "We will find you a pretty
little wife, and you can rear your children. In your leisure moments
you can write the history of the great deeds you have done. You will
want for nothing: youth, health, fortune,
family,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg
248]</a></span> all that makes up the happiness of men, is yours. Why
then should you not be happy?"</p>

<p>Leon and his parents talked with him in the same way. Everything
appertaining to the festive occasion was forgotten in the presence of
an affliction so real and a dejection so profound.</p>

<p>He roused himself little by little, and even sang, at dessert, a
little song which he had prepared for the occasion.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The verses were loudly applauded, but the poor Colonel smiled
sadly, talked but little, and did not get fuddled at all. The man with
the broken ear could not at all console himself for having a slit
ear.<a name="FNanchor_11_11"
id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[11]</sup></a> He took part in the various
diversions of the day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249"
id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> but was no longer the brilliant
companion who had inspired everything with his impetuous gayety.</p>

<p>The Marshal buttonholed him during the evening and said: "What are
you thinking about?"</p>

<p>"I'm thinking of the old messmates who were happy enough to fall at
Waterloo with their faces toward the enemy. That old fool of a
Dutchman who preserved me for posterity, did me but a sorry service. I
tell you, Leblanc, a man ought to live in his own day. Later is too
late."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw, Fougas, don't talk nonsense! There's nothing desperate
in the case. Devil take it! I'll go to see the Emperor to-morrow. The
matter shall be looked into. It will all be set straight. Men like
you! Why France hasn't got them by the dozen that she should fling
them among the soiled linen."</p>

<p>"Thanks! You're a good old boy, and a true one. There were five
hundred thousand of us, of the same, same sort, in 1812; there are but
two left; say, rather, one and a half."</p>

<p>About ten o'clock in the evening, M. Rollon, M. du Marnet and
Fougas accompanied the Marshal to the cars. Fougas embraced his
comrade and promised him to be of good cheer. After the train left,
the three colonels went back to town on foot. In passing M. Rollon's
house, Fougas said to his successor:</p>

<p>"You're not very hospitable to-night; you don't even offer us a
pony of that good Andaye
brandy!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg
250]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought you were not in drinking trim," said M. Rollon. "You
didn't take anything in your coffee or afterwards. But come up!"</p>

<p>"My thirst has come back with a vengeance."</p>

<p>"That's a good symptom."</p>

<p>He drank in a melancholy fashion, and scarcely wet his lips in his
glass. He stopped a little while before the flag, took hold of the
staff, spread out the silk, counted the holes that cannon balls and
bullets had made in it, and could not repress his tears. "Positively,"
said he, "the brandy has taken me in the throat; I'm not a man
to-night. Good evening, gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Hold on! We'll go back with you."</p>

<p>"Oh, my hotel is only a step."</p>

<p>"It's all the same. But what's your idea in staying at a hotel when
you have two houses in town at your service?"</p>

<p>"On the strength of that, I am going to move to-morrow."</p>

<p>The next morning, about eleven o'clock, the happy Leon was at his
toilet when a telegram was brought to him. He opened it without
noticing that it was addressed to M. Fougas, and uttered a cry of joy.
Here is the laconic message which brought him so much pleasure:</p>

<blockquote><p>"To Colonel Fougas, Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>"Just left the Emperor. You to be brevet brigadier until something
better turns up. If necessary, <i>corps legislatif</i> will amend
law.</p>

<p>"<span
class="smcap">Leblanc</span>." </p></blockquote><p><span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg
251]</a></span></p>

<p>Leon dressed himself, ran to the hotel of the blue sundial, and
found Fougas dead in his bed.</p>

<p>It is said in Fontainebleau, that M. Nibor made an autopsy, and
found that serious disorders had been produced by desiccation. Some
people are nevertheless satisfied that Fougas committed suicide. It is
certain that Master Bonnivet received, by the penny post, a sort of a
will, expressed thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I leave my heart to my country, my memory to natural
affection, my example to the army, my hate to perfidious Albion, fifty
thousand francs to Gothon, and two hundred thousand to the 23d of the
line. And forever <i>Vive l'Empereur!</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Fougas</span>." </p></blockquote>

<p>Resuscitated on the 17th of August, between three and four in the
afternoon, he died on the 17th of the following month, at what hour we
shall never know. His second life had lasted a little less than
thirty-one days. But it is simple justice to say that he made good use
of his time. He reposes in the spot which young Renault had bought for
him. His granddaughter Clementine left off her mourning about a year
since. She is beloved and happy, and Leon will have nothing to
reproach himself with if she does not have plenty of children.</p>

by the two young noblemen is M. About's own. It is certainly such
English as Frenchmen would be apt to speak, and it is as fair to
attribute that fact to M. About's fine sense of the requirements of
the occasion, as to lack of familiarity with our language.
